"<p>For me being online schooled is hard but I get through the day, at school at recess and lunch I would normally be playing tip and running around a lot but since I&#8217;ve been in quarantine I haven&#8217;t been getting much exercise apart from a half-hour run now and then. </p>\n <p>Covid Corvids.<br />\nApril 2020</p>\n<p>Always from the north, strung out like stars across the sky,<br />\nthey came.<br />\nGrowing louder, larger, in ever increasing flocks.<br />\nCrops stuffed with glazed-eyed travellers<br />\nmechanically pecking<br />\nat packets of nuts.<br />\nTipping wine into upturned mouths.<br />\nTorsos squishing into seats, limbs pouring over armrests<br />\nlike Angophora roots over rocks.</p>\n<p>Never ending waves of stiff winged corvids.<br />\nDisgorging swarms onto tarmac wastelands like a plague, a virus.<br />\nBefore once more rising<br />\nmoving money and men,<br />\nfilling the sky with noise and pollution and people.</p>\n<p>Once upon a childhood,<br />\ncatching distant vibrations of an approaching roar<br />\nwe’d race each other outside.<br />\nChins jutting upwards, bare feet twirling bodies in circles,<br />\nsmall hands sheltering foreheads,<br />\nthumbs curling under eyes making imaginary binoculars<br />\nsearching blue African skies.<br />\nEager to be first to spot it,<br />\nto point it out,<br />\nto decide where it was going.<br />\nChina,<br />\nAmerica,<br />\nEngland,<br />\nAustralia!</p>\n<p>In our world, no plane ever arrived!</p>\n<p>Now, stars seldom travel from the north over Sydney skies.<br />\nElastic stretched, beads smaller, gaps between them growing larger.<br />\nOverstretched, the sparkling necklace<br />\nbreaks.</p>\n<p>Stringing washing on the line, I hear the roar of a solitary aircraft.<br />\nLooking up I wonder&#8230;<br />\nCould we once more stare in awe,<br />\nmarvelling at the magic of our flight?</p>\n <p>My name is Emma and I am from Sydney. I live around North Sydney, and pretty far away from my school. When it comes to convinience, online school is a lot easier, but I think normally travelling far is worth it. I quite enjoy online school, but I sometimes miss hanging out with my friends and classmates.</p>\n<p>The main thing I dislike about this virus is that I can&#8217;t go do sports or do a lot of outdoor activities. I love swimming and tennis, and I really miss doing them. In other ways, I don&#8217;t think it was very hard to get used to living differently. I feel like the only thing that annoys me about online school is the fact that I get so distracted. It just feels like there is no one there to tell you that you have to focus and then I just get bored and naturally go to watch videos or something. This is another thing I dislike. The more I stay at home, the more time I waste on social media, and I feel like I need to take a break from it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently at school while typing this, and currently its going ok. I was happy to see my friends and classmates. I hope that everything is going to be okay and that we can fight through this virus together.</p>\n <p>I don&#8217;t Like staying at home . I don&#8217;t Like the corona virus because we have to stay away from nan and pop. I don&#8217;t like it beacuse people get sick</p>\n <p>At the start of Covid 19 isolation, Emma (Watson) Wiggle and her Wiggle friends brought out a video called &#8220;Social Distancing.&#8221; The 3 verses and chorus taught big and small kids why we couldn&#8217;t go to Nanna&#8217;s house, why we had to wash our hands and why we shouldn&#8217;t have parties at home. Thank you Wiggles, for your clever lyrics and video.</p>\n <p>Covid-19 has affected all of us deeply, just a couple months ago we were all fighting for toilet paper. That was just the tip of the iceberg, now look at us. Quarantined for months and months. They say a cure won’t come out until at least December. We’re stuck like this. All of us need to cooperate or nobody will make it out alive. Wash your hands, sanitize, stay as far as you can from people. Stay at home.</p>\n <p>Dear diary,</p>\n<p>So far 2020 has been the toughest year of my life. What I thought was going to be a new experience, mainly because of a new school, new friends, new teachers and new subjects, was very different to what i had imagined. This goes to show that life teaches you the lesson to learn to trust the journey, even when you do not understand it.</p>\n<p>At first the news about coronavirus took me by surprise. I felt like a wave of resentfulness was washed upon, due to the news. I had just bonded with friends, I had just gotten used to high school life, but then Covid 19 forced us to stay indoors.</p>\n<p>The trip to America where we were going to see our cousins for the first time in 8 years was cancelled. My public speaking competition was cancelled, IMP was cancelled, debating you name it. But after a while it made me realise how selfish i was being. People out there who are all alone trapped inside their doors. Like senior citizens, nurses and doctors and even my grandma.</p>\n<p>This is the time where i decided to spend time with my family more. Although my parents were busy with work and my brothers were spending every second of their time gaming (until they were told off), I was blessed to have a family to be stuck inside with. Even though covid 19 was definitely not a good thing to happen to our world, it made my family closer together then we would ever be. But knowing Australia, knowing the world, and how good we are at rising above problems, I know we will get through this together and it won’t be the end of our world.</p>\n <p>Yesterday I was all ready to head to the supermarket and I remembered reading that before you go out, ask yourself, &#8220;Is this essential?&#8221; I ran my eye down the list of items and nothing; absolutely nothing was essential; things I thought I needed, but not essential. I think the whole concept of essential might take on a very different meaning as we live our way through this pandemic. </p>\n<p>We will go without many things over the coming months and maybe we will discover that it really doesn’t make a whole lot of difference. Perhaps our whole perception of what’s important will be transformed and maybe even what we value. I wonder if the silver lining of this scary, confronting season will be the paring back of all the extraneous things that have been clogging up our lives and relationships. </p>\n<p>Hopefully, the intangibles will rise to the surface and we’ll have the time to become reacquainted with their value. I hope we will all live a little differently in the future because we’ve walked through these dark days.</p>\n <p>Today I woke up at 8 o&#8217;clock. One and a half hours later than usual. Everyone is complaining about Covid-19 and how hard staying at home away from everyone and doing online work is but I see the whole situation differently. </p>\n<p>Because we stay at home to do work I can sleep in and catch up on all the sleep I&#8217;ve been missing due to waking up early to get to school on time. Instead, I can get my 9 hours of sleep easily and still have time to do my work at night and be at school on time. </p>\n<p>This situation also relieves me of social pressures like does my skin look ok, what about my hair, who am going to sit with, what am I going to say or how am I going to act. This allows me to just focus on my work and complete it at my own pace but still have time to rest and relax. I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m just a lot happier without having to go out and just feel bad from being tired and all the effort I put into social situations that go nowhere and leave me feeling worse than before. </p>\n<p>This is just my point of view, but I genuinely don&#8217;t want to go back. I know I have to but I&#8217;m sort of glad this pandemic happened, not because of the virus side of it but the break that we all finally get. </p>\n <p>廣東話 Hong Kong Cantonese<br />\n呢一年真係好難過😫，由2019 三月中開始，香港人protest，我响Sydney除左晚晚喊都唔知可以做咩。睇任D後生仔被police 折磨真係好心痛。跟著NSW山林大火，又擔心到不得了。冇幾耐，大陸死得人多，我自己經歷過2003 SARS真係好討厭將SARS帶來香港的大陸人。更擔心大陸政府講大話害死人。結果全世界幾多人死咗？已經多過成年都冇好好瞓覺，so tired&#8230;<br />\n光復香港<br />\n時代革命</p>\n <p>I sit<br />\nI think<br />\nI struggle then sink<br />\nI think<br />\nI sit<br />\nI dig my pit</p>\n<p>Hidden threat, where are you?<br />\nSome echoed words bottle-fed me the news<br />\nMurdoch taunted me for the dole<br />\nUntil the threat lapped at their shores</p>\n<p>&#8220;What a blessing! In disguise!&#8221;<br />\nYou seem to chant with well slept eyes<br />\nBills are teasing, collection due<br />\nWhat a blessing, so says you</p>\n <p>Deliriously happy to be working from home. Grateful to be working. The gentle joy of sanctioned isolation. So selfish! Should be tsk tsk-ing about losing the things I love, instead I&#8217;m doing the things I love: no small talk in the tea room, no concern for presentation and the shameful secret of neglected hygiene. This is the agoraphobic&#8217;s dream come true. </p>\n<p>Covid and it&#8217;s period of isolation seems to&#8217;ve left everyone in a kind of state of trauma and/or grief, to varying degrees. And, as with any big grief (death of a parent etc) it brings out people&#8217;s pathologies: whatever pathological psychology was there before the grief becomes bigger and worse. I&#8217;m seeing it in many, myself included. My default is to go to ground&#8230;which is why being told to self isolate is just gold for me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a song. I&#8217;d previously written a couple of poems that were put to music by my guitarist (pre-covid, I was half of a duo that played two evenings a week. It&#8217;s missed). This one I did all by myself. It&#8217;s been a relief to not commute and I&#8217;ve spent some of the time playing guitar, learning cords and putting them to these lyrics. And drawing &#8211; I&#8217;ve been drawing shells. Both of these artistic pursuits are as secretive as my smelly armpits. It can&#8217;t be a bad song if no-one else hears it&#8230;it will always be the best song I&#8217;ve ever written as long as it remains the only song I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n <p>We started 2020 with such great optimism, in spite of the terrible fires and drought of 2019 we thought that the start of the new decade would bring better times, our optimism was unfortunately misplaced………</p>\n<p>On the 16 March I stopped attending the Gym due to the increasing risk of the Corona Virus, this was the start of our self-imposed lockdown, just before the mandatory shut-down was imposed by the government, my wife Rosemary and I were now a team of two, isolated from our family and friends, so we set about re-organising our life to keep us busy during this lockdown. </p>\n<p>Before the lockdown Rosemary and I had a busy lifestyle, Gym three mornings a week, U3A meetings on other days and household chores, garden maintenance, shopping and socialising filling in the rest of the week. </p>\n<p>Our new daily routine now consists of a morning walk for about one hour every second day, on alternate days we do floor exercises to try and keep our fitness up, (well that was the plan but as time went it got harder to maintain).  </p>\n<p>We keep in touch with our family using face-time which we do once a week, it would be nice to do it more often but there is not much to discuss, what can you say that you didn’t talk about last week, it’s nice to be able to see and talk to each other but it not the same as being together, it’s the body language and the sense of being together that really counts, I think social networking is better than nothing but it can’t replace personal contact, or maybe  I’m just old fashioned. </p>\n <p>Woman with a scowl stretched her arm to maintain the 1.5 metre (naturally, it was less than that) distance as we pass – everyone is a threat or carrier! Then there have been days where complete strangers greet you, something uncommon in our streets. The pandemic has truly brought the best and worst in us. </p>\n<p>After my meditation/yoga routine, do a few exercises from FitOn. Many benefits of working from home. Now I hop out of bed, my office is right next to it, can keep the distinction between work and home. </p>\n<p>Spending time with Zoom sessions and podcasts, had almost daily Zoom sessions this week, hectic. Love busying myself at home, Zoom sessions take care of ‘socialising’, sometimes with trivia. </p>\n<p>Today is library book drop day – so grateful to the rangers. To see this sense of community and service is most heart-warming, go libraries! </p>\n<p>Have become selective with melancholic news.  Donate to Dymocks for books to kids with no access to reading material. Most of the local cafes decided to do takeaway&#8230;feel compelled to buy a chai or sandwich. People are trying.</p>\n<p>Great speaking with Linda in Vancouver yesterday after 30+ years and it took COVID for me to make the WhatsApp call. She emailed and we vowed to do it again!</p>\n<p>At peace with getting through projects at home. Attempted bread making as love cooking. Will try with cumin seeds and fried onion…can smell it baking already!</p>\n<p>Weekly movie with Rita as i&#8217;s Friday, seeing my other daughter tomorrow, yay!</p>\n<p>Reflect more on how I would like to spend my retirement in a few years –  meaningful creativity, continue studying French, reading. My daughters may be living overseas so trips to visit them. Graciousness and greater focus on meaning of life will continue to be my mantra.</p>\n <p>i never knew toilet paper could be so valuable it was something everybody had and there was plenty of. now it was like gold. the same thing for hand sanitizer i thought it was good to have but now it is nearly like diamond.</p>\n<p>there are multiple issues with the media now they wont stop blowing everything up and making sound it was so much werse than what it was the issue with this was it caused panic. but the way to slow it down is to stay safe by not touching everything and only leaving the house for necessary things like food and education this is Australia not america or other country&#8217;s we were doing well so going to school was not a big issue.</p>\n <p>The day it all started my mum immediately wouldn&#8217;t let me go to school. I felt like I was missing out on so much, and because I had JUST met my friends I felt like I was drifting away from them. I was so worried that I would get it because I have a lot of things that &#8216;trigger&#8217; my anxiety, and unfortunately, this was one of them.</p>\n<p>As the &#8216;virus&#8217; was getting worse everything was being abandoned, and my bird went missing during this time, it was also my mum&#8217;s birthday. I had a mental breakdown and couldn&#8217;t sleep at night. Then it became so bad that everyone had to stay home, I was glad I could call my friends and actually do work because I felt like I was going to come back to school being stupid.</p>\n<p>Everything was going well until the virus started to somewhat &#8216;calm down&#8217;, but I was nervous to go to school, it was like a second first impression. When we bought the school uniform the blazer looked massive on me because i&#8217;m a bit under weight, and again, this is one of the things that &#8216;triggers&#8217; me. I went to school the next day with no jacket and I get cold VERY easily, but the next day my smaller blazer came in and I was so happy.</p>\n<p>I completely forgot all my worries and I went to school happy to see my friends, I don&#8217;t know why everyone was so worried. Especially since they started stacking up on toilet paper. ;-;</p>\n <p>My name is Patrick Cannon and I love playing Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 76 with my friend Ty. Now is a bad time for everyone. I&#8217;m not seeing people very often, zoom doesn&#8217;t work very often and I don&#8217;t like seeing people on technology. It doesn&#8217;t feel like their actually there. Its just a screen that you look at. I feel like a dog staring at a screen and because they are color blind they can&#8217;t see the characters and only can hear the sound.</p>\n<p>I just want to be at home but with everyone I like. My friends, family, cousins, teachers and students. But we can&#8217;t do that because of coronavirus restrictions.</p>\n <p>hi my name is Tyson and I am 12 I have been staying at home doing nothing but playing games and doing online school its been boring you can&#8217;t do some things outside like go to the cafes and pubs the only thing you can do is walk or ride a bike so stay at home.</p>\n <p>The time of covid 19 was very stressful. Everyone had to fight for their right to get a box of tissue paper, no one could see their family or friends, no one could go out and have fun anymore, life was just miserable to everybody in the world. Every Continet and Country was impacted by Covid 19. We were all living like a rock.</p>\n <p>During Quarantine, my days have been pretty short. With only school work and the marathons fox8 play keeping me sane, Quarantine has been very frustrating. I have picked up some hobbies such as knitting, baking and writing, as well as furthering my abilities in art.</p>\n<p>Before, I hated facetime; only using it in most desperate cases. Although, with the infamous corona virus constantly on the rise, it&#8217;s became a very useful application and takes up most of my time. Starting and holding conversations have been difficult, not only with no subject or gossip but also with the constant lagging.</p>\n<p>Though, lets give thanks to the marvel writers giving us the ability to keep on bringing up the fact that they have made a very poor choice in their newest comic.</p>\n <p>COVID-19<br />\nHAS BEEN NOT GOOD STUFF IS NOT HERE WE DO NOT HAVE TOILET PAPER<br />\nTOILET PAPER IS NOT HERE WE NEED IT AND A LOT OF STUFF COVID -19 IS NOT FUN</p>\n <p>I am a 12 year old girl in Australia that is currently living through the Corona Virus Pandemic. The last 6 weeks I have been a prisoner in my own home. The only social connection I get is when I go to get groceries, that is once literally once a week. I never appreciated socializing, school, normal life more than now. Life is hard, lonely, stressful, horrible! It&#8217;s hard to think about life after COVID-19. Nothing will go back to normal, it&#8217;s sad! I just hope that we get over this soon even though they say it&#8217;ll be a 12 months! I hope that everyone keeps safe!</p>\n <p>Covid &#8211; 19 has changed many people and has changed me I have become closer to my friends and family and finally seeing my teachers and my friends has made me so happy.</p>\n<p>I never thought of me, my friends, my family and everyone else would ever be in a pandemic. Toilet Paper is also now the new trend. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?</p>\n <p>Even though this situation made everyone sad it made us stronger and closer as a country (even though we can&#8217;t go closer to each other).</p>\n<p>Being at home for more than 6 weeks was boring it was quite relaxing because you can sleep in and get food whenever you want. being home schooled was horrible..I couldn&#8217;t see my friends and teachers and if you didn&#8217;t understand a task you had to send a email and wait for them to reply.</p>\n<p>I called my friends everyday but it wasn&#8217;t the same :( even though this was a horrible time some many people and I are grateful for this because no one will ever look at toilet paper the same and will be so happy to go out with friends and family.</p>\n <p>When Covid 19 first came and school got cancelled I thought a dream had come true, we didn&#8217;t have to go to school, I could stay home and watch TV all day! But as it turns out, it&#8217;s more of a punishment than reward, all my sports got cancelled, I couldn&#8217;t see my friends because of self isolation and school work could be confusing without a teacher especially since I had started high school this year.</p>\n<p>Another bad thing was that I was in a house full time with my family since only people who had important needed jobs could go to work, but being together all the time not able to leave could get a bit stressful. Suddenly I was starting to think the Coronavirus wasn&#8217;t that great after all.</p>\n<p>I hope doctors find a cure soon or the outbreak slows down so we can go back to going to school 5 days a week, play our sports and train for them, catch up with our friends and see them again. I hope that I never have to go through something like Covid 19 after this ever again.</p>\n <p>&#8220;The first case of COVID-19, confirmed in Wuhan, China.&#8221; Oh, it won&#8217;t be anything. Just another harmless disease floating around. &#8220;Multiple cases have now been confirmed of COVID-19, and concern is spreading of what is to come with the virus.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll figure out a way to stop it&#8230; anyway, nothing bad will happen. &#8220;The first death from COVID-19 has been officially confirmed in Wuhan, China.&#8221; Okay, this might be a pretty serious problem. I will just stay away from people who are showing possible signs of sickness and stay cautious of my health.</p>\n<p>Sports? Cancelled. Events? Cancelled. Celebrations? Cancelled. The world was unprepared for an unprecedented virus, which will take over the world and claim thousands of lives. While I am barely affected by this virus, there are those around the world who have lost their loved ones and their friends. How long will this go on for? Will there be a cure developed to save us all? Nobody knows. There are scientists makings trials after trials, trying to develop a vaccine. People around the world are in complete lockdown, obstructed from the outside world. What is yet to come is unknown.</p>\n <p>This time is how do I say it weird, yeah weird. Before the pandemic life was normal, everything was a routine you start the week at school on Monday and when you get home you do homework and then you do what you want. Then at the end of the week, you have free time to do what you want. But now it&#8217;s different the world will change forever and mostly for good.</p>\n <p>The worst time of many peoples lives and some of the greatest. People staying inside, deaths and many more horrible things but&#8230; bonding with family, taking more time for yourself and finding out new things.</p>\n<p>For many kids they have actually had that extra hour of sleep. Yes we have to still continue school but at least now we can get work done faster and more in depth.</p>\n<p>There are many amazing things about this pandemic but there are many bad things. People have suffered and endured pain. maybe we have all realised that we just want to be with people, we crave human interaction.</p>\n<p>This pandemic has brought communities together, maybe when this all ends we should do some of the things that we did in quarantine. Maybe we should appreciate more of the good things but we will never forget all the people who have suffered.</p>\n <p>covid 19</p>\n<p>Every day there was no school</p>\n<p>At the end it is not so cool</p>\n<p>Stuck in side is not life</p>\n<p>Finally eating with my wife</p>\n<p>I hope this won&#8217;t last</p>\n<p>Tring to leave it in the past</p>\n <p>Staying home,<br />\nGoing on zoom,<br />\non my phone,<br />\nIn my room,<br />\nDoing school work all online,<br />\nTry to get in in on time,<br />\nSpend the day by ourselves,<br />\nNo toilet paper on the shelves,<br />\nMaking sure everything’s clean,<br />\nWhile we&#8217;re stuck in quarantine,</p>\n <p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>Returning to school was amazing, seeing all my friends and teachers. I just wanted to interact and sit with my friends laughing and talking. During the pandemic I tried a lot of cool things that were out of my comfort zones like cooking with my mum and baking with my dad.</p>\n<p>I read 5 books during the corona virus and i REALLY enjoyed it I also discovered that I love reading romantic books. I got to spend a lot of time with my family to a point where it got crazy. Now I realize how much I depend on my family members and and friends.</p>\n <p>I actually missed school. I mean I didn&#8217;t think I would at all, I thought that learning and being at home would be great and that I wouldn&#8217;t miss school at all.</p>\n<p>Well I don&#8217;t really miss &#8216;school&#8217;, I miss the little things about school, like seeing my friends, listening to my teachers, being in my school uniform and in the school environment. (I obviously don&#8217;t miss homework like that has been one of the only good things about this pandemic 😂)</p>\n<p>I am now grateful for the little things in life that I didn&#8217;t even notice before.<br />\n&#8211; I miss seeing my nonna + nonno<br />\n&#8211; I miss going to school everyday and seeing my friends<br />\n&#8211; I miss going to the shops and seeing isles full of food and drinks<br />\n&#8211; I miss physical contact!!!!</p>\n<p>Over all, although this pandemic has been hard, I think it has connected our country in a way that never would have happend!</p>\n <p>COVID-19</p>\n<p>My life before Covid-19 was normal, get up at 6:45, eat breakfast, get dressed, brush my teeth then play with my dog and go to school. Get home from school, do some homework, have a snack and watch tik tok.</p>\n<p>What life is like living through a pandemic:<br />\nGet up just in time for homeroom, get some breakfast, Start school, go for a swim, have a shower, do some more work, have lunch and then do whatever until dinner.</p>\n<p>My life overall is just different, it is very hard not seeing my friends everyday and go out with them, but there is no other place that I would be during this time.</p>\n <p>Dear The Diary Files,<br />\nWhen I am older I will remember this time.<br />\nThe time that I am almost all alone,<br />\nJust my Father, Sister and I .</p>\n<p>Working hard and looking forward to the bike-ride at the end of the day .</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the day when we go back to school,<br />\nlooking forward to the day when we see our friends again.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the day this pandemic would end ,<br />\nand on that day . . . WE WOULD CELEBRATE!!!</p>\n<p>I miss my normal life,<br />\nI miss my Brother and my older Sister .</p>\n<p>I but I miss most of all . . . Freedom,<br />\nFreedom to live my life .</p>\n <p>Corona Virus</p>\n<p>This is not the best time of my life, well at least that is what I think but I have never realised the fact that this has made a change for some good reasons.</p>\n<p>I realise that I made ice cream for the first time, why is it my first time? I have gone for a walk each day, why haven&#8217;t I done this before? I had a video call with my cousins in a different country for the first time, why? I have only realised this now but this is going to be remembered from me forever. This will be a memory that I won&#8217;t ever forget.</p>\n<p>I have never used technology this much, for a learning reason. Technology, voice calling, face timing, zooming, I didn&#8217;t think that humanity would be this connected if this virus came 50 years ago. This might be a change for good, this might be a very bad time but good time at the same time.</p>\n<p>This virus has made us be more connected thanks to technology.</p>\n <p>No one told me that it would be my last day, my last opportunity to see my friends, my last opportunity to go outside on errands or for recreational activity. It happened so quickly. However, as much as I miss my normal life, my normal routine I acknowledge how little my life has been affected.</p>\n<p>This global pandemic that everyone loathes isn&#8217;t as terrible for me. Others,on the other hand, have lost their only job, struggle to afford rent and have relatives dying.</p>\n <p>the coronavirus has changed my life allot the past 6 weeks. i haven&#8217;t been able to see friends and older family members, in december on my phone a news article came up about a chinese virus but my mother said to not worry.</p>\n<p>It turns out that when i was in Fiji in January i found out it was about the coronavirus and I was scared to come back to Australia. Social distancing, excess hand washing and not seeing the elderly people has changed my life allot and everyone has to be super careful because you don&#8217;t know who is carrying the virus which is scary.</p>\n <p>During the Pandemic, isolation has been a very fun journey. I have been able to stay home with my pets, bond with my family, bake and do many things that I put off.</p>\n<p>I have been able to connect with myself and I have been able to better myself and connect with my family and spend more time with them. I have been able to babysit my pets and along with that be home alone with my sister. I have also enjoyed online learning very much. I was able to go at my own pace and to ask for help from my family.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed being able to go on family hikes and walk on the weekends as we had nothing to do. Overall I have enjoyed the positives of the Pandemic and we have been able to better our world and heal mother nature.</p>\n <p>in my opinion, this pandemic has brought out the best and the worst of people.</p>\n<p>some people have gone mad about toilet paper and food with preservatives. and others have still stayed at the frontlines of the medical work all the wonderful people have done. all the doctors, nurses, emergency workers, and scientists have done for the world are forever immortal. and deserve some of the highest honor forever.</p>\n<p>some other things have happened during this period such as new planets being found millions of light-years away this period will be unforgettable in the history of the world and generation to come will continue learning about COVID 19</p>\n <p>Trapped inside for several weeks, was not how I expected my first year of high school to be like.</p>\n<p>There were brutal fights over toilet paper and no rice or flour left in my local supermarkets.</p>\n<p>I miss my friends and giving them cuddles. I miss seeing my grandma and catching up with her about our days. I started to get constant head aches from looking at a screen and my brain started hurting from working almost all day. The only time I got to see my friends was through Face Time, I couldn&#8217;t see my best friends for 2 months.</p>\n<p>But in Australia it&#8217;s not as bad as Italy or Spain, so there is no place I&#8217;d rather been in isolation then Australia.</p>\n <p>Before covid 19 I was in the same routeen but now I have been going for walks and baking and spent more time with my family and appreciate our family.</p>\n<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for covid 19 I wouldn&#8217;t have nown that you put lemonade in scones. If it wasn&#8217;t for covid 19 India would have never seen the blue sky for the first time, i think that covid 19 was a good and bad thing that happened.</p>\n<p>When you go to school some kids are like i wish there was no school but when you aren&#8217;t there you really miss it and miss seeing your everyday.</p>\n <p>As beginning to be a high school student it was at first worrying what would happen during this time, but as soon as I got over that feeling knowing that the school had plans and everything was fine I was excited to see what online learning was like.</p>\n<p>Online learning is a completely different type of learning where in a class you are surrounded by things that make you feel like you should be learning while at home it makes it so easy to get distracted.</p>\n<p>Being separated from everyone outside, no meeting in person. This wasn&#8217;t as much of a challenge for me as I imagine it would&#8217;ve been for others because I had much more than just contacting friends online.</p>\n<p>I have a very large family, there&#8217;s 9 of us I&#8217;m the youngest child out of 4 boys and 3 girls. Having 3 brothers and 3 sisters makes very challenging dynamic because by the time I was born my oldest brother was already leaving high school the year after.</p>\n<p>Although one of my brothers and two of my sisters have moved out though one of my sisters lives in a granny-flat in the backyard with her husband. They have the 3 children 2 boys and 1 girl, this made me an uncle at the age of 5, one of my sisters also lives with us in our house.<br />\nSo even though we were in isolation I still had many people to talk to in person, 12 to be exact.</p>\n<p>This time definitely presents a challenge to the world but hopefully we can use this to expand and improve the world.</p>\n <p>The current situation(covid 19) did both good at the beginning but worsened as the situation continued.</p>\n<p>At the beginning it was nothing much, we just had to stay at home. Then I thought it would be nice to stay at home. But soon I realised I could do what i took for granted. I hope the pandemic finishes soon.</p>\n <p>As a 12 year old living in Australia the Covid-19 outbreak was a sudden movement throughout the entirety of Australia.</p>\n<p>This outbreak affected many Aussie lives and other people on a global scale. For me this was a great break to rethink and understand what I really am doing,</p>\n<p>I started by going to my home gym and improving myself, after I really found my taste in music and reading more helped me understand what I want to do.</p>\n<p>In Australia it&#8217;s great as we are a country that is girt by sea and I couldn&#8217;t be more grateful.</p>\n <p>The Day we Disappeared from School</p>\n<p>The COVID 19 global pandemic was unexpected. One day we were at school, the next day we weren&#8217;t. We had &#8220;disappeared&#8221; from school.<br />\nBeing at home has its positives and negatives.</p>\n<p>Some of the positives were that we got to spend more time with our family and play board games or watch movies with them. I also found many opportunities to do new things and find amazing talents that I may not have known I even had.</p>\n<p>There were certain negatives as well. Doing school work at home can be a bit of a challenge and getting bored out of my mind happened a<br />\nlot too.</p>\n<p>But overall, it made me realise the things in life that are so precious. Seeing all the nice stories on the news about people finding special ways to communicate and play with each other. I think it has made me a better person.</p>\n <p>Dear COVID 19,</p>\n<p>You have taken so much away from me. Like taking my friends away from me, and my life. Football. I am so bored now, I can&#8217;t even go outside anymore. The most I can do is go outside in my backyard and play basketball, football/soccer, and my dog. You are the worst thing that has happened in my life but you have made me spend time with my family.</p>\n <p>My name is Tiffany, I am 13 years old. I live in Sydney, Riverwood.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus or as many know as Covid19 has changed my lifestyle, time seems to pass quicker. Quarantine has been a time were i can reflect on myself, although it has made me more stressed and more unorganised. I’ve become more distant to most of my friends such as not talking or even texting them, decisions I would’ve had made before have changed. Rather than spending more time with my family, it seems like there’s less time, i&#8217;m always at the desk doing my work or playing games.</p>\n<p>Recently it’s been cold and getting up in the mornings have already been harder than ever. The feeling of not wanting to get out of your comfort area. Because of isolation, I haven’t gone out much, however I don’t dislike it. I used to really enjoy going to school and playing with my friends but after the holidays I like staying at home watching videos or just hanging out with my dog. I’ve found that it’s refreshing to listen to music in a dark room, it makes everything feel more calm.</p>\n<p>Online School has been tricky with all my technology always acting up, it’s harder to ask the teacher questions and for me to explain my question into a sentence without showing. My email became clogged up with Google Classroom and I wasn’t sure which subject was which. It seems that my dog is enjoying Covid19 more than everyone.</p>\n <p>I guess life should return to normal sometime. We have most likely flattened the curve and we are coming out of lockdown, slowly. Will life return to normal soon? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n<p>I was at home for anywhere from two and a half to three months, I don&#8217;t know, because I&#8217;ve lost track of time. Only now I&#8217;ve gone back to school and this is my second day of being back in the classroom. It&#8217;s been a strange experience working from home.</p>\n<p>Before I didn&#8217;t appreciate being at school, I found it to be quite an annoyance, but now after all this madness, I feel that I&#8217;m very lucky that I have a classroom to go to and an education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <p>There are many thoughts going in my head at the moment. Good and Bad. 2020 is a rollercoaster ride with many ups and downs. This year we have had a new disease named COVID-19 this started in China and has since spread all throughout the world so therefore it was named a Global Pandemic. This situation has put many activities on hold.</p>\n<p>Like traveling, Sport and even school got stopped for me!!! But on the 11th May 2020, Marist Catholic College Penshurst yr 7 students went back to school 4 days a week and yr 8-11 once a week.</p>\n<p>A thing that made me understand is how not to take things for granted and to appreciate what we have cause one day it could be all gone just like now.</p>\n<p>If this ever happens again there are many things you can do.<br />\nEg. Paint, learn something new.</p>\n <p>Dear people of the future,</p>\n<p>My name is Niki and I am a twelve year old living through the COVID-19 pandemic. I was at school when I found out about the outbreak of the virus and I didn&#8217;t think much of it.</p>\n<p>Weeks after, restrictions were put in at our school. No touching anything if not needed, no touching friends, and no touching your face. It was a very surreal experience.</p>\n<p>A week after that, I was at home, working in my pyjamas while doing my schoolwork posted on my computer. It sounds amazing doesn&#8217;t it? Well that&#8217;s what i thought for the first week in complete isolation. You can simply walk to the fridge in the middle of a science or history lesson and you have no one to motivate you to work. But that is what I found challenging.</p>\n<p>When there&#8217;s no rules and no teachers to tell you to keep working, I wasn&#8217;t motivated enough to keep working and I missed a lot of work and that made me stressed and confused. But finally, I am back at school. There are strict restrictions, even stricter than before isolation, but at least I get to see my friends rather than seeing them on a screen.</p>\n<p>Sure, it was fun drinking tea while working or drawing chalk on the driveway, but coming to school on a crisp May morning has never felt so good.</p>\n<p>From Niki</p>\n <p>School. Thats what us kids revolve around. These days, That&#8217;s all there is.</p>\n<p>So this is a supposed to be a documentary history thing, But nothing is happening. Except school.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, It seems like school is even more boring and trite than normal. Thank god that i&#8217;m at real school now, But all I&#8217;m doing is doing stuff on quotev. I dunno what to do.\\</p>\n<p>so yeah. History sucks<br />\nbaiii</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m David and I&#8217;m an Australian citizen of Ukrainian descent. We came here in 1993.</p>\n<p>To tell the truth, my life haven&#8217;t changed much since the event of Covid-19.<br />\nMy wife is disabled and even before the pandemic we were pretty much confined to our house.</p>\n<p>The major difference the current lockdown rules have made is the inability to see our kids and grandchildren. We have resorted to talking to them on the phone and occasional Skype conferences.</p>\n<p>Aside from some inconvenience whilst shopping and getting around there has been no mayor impact on our family lives due to the virus.</p>\n<p>Having said that &#8211; my cousin from New York City has passed away&#8230; Covid-19 had cut her life short&#8230;</p>\n <p>What COVID 19 has taught me:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Online learning has amplified the fact that the teachers decide the fate of the students. They can either make the lesson interactive and enjoyable or the most boring thing you&#8217;ve ever done in your life</p>\n<p>&#8211; Board games relieve all boredom</p>\n<p>&#8211; Exercise can be fun (Thanks for nothing PE teachers)</p>\n<p>&#8211; Even the small things like going for a walk are extremely important in our lives</p>\n<p>&#8211; If I thought I was socially awkward before, I definitely am now</p>\n<p>&#8211; If I ignore the fridge and only eat 3 meals a day, I can demonstrate the self control to not cheat all my online tests</p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m bored&#8221; has a whole new meaning</p>\n<p>&#8211; The most important items for most of the Australian population in a lockdown is: toilet paper, pasta sauce, rice, tissues and hand sanitizer (what more could you want?)</p>\n <p>Dearest Diary,</p>\n<p>usually people would be writing for the core reason that something extreme is going on in their life. That however is not the case for me. Thinking about it now, if the unspoken rule did not apply to me, I have no doubt there would be many others doing the same.</p>\n<p>I am not special&#8230;but I am certain this moment is.</p>\n<p>All things in life at the moment have appeared to stop. Halting in place. It was as if I had woken up early morning to watch the water still in front of me. It was full of youth, lacking wrinkles another would envy. No boats, no birds, no fish. Everyone appeared to have rested their eyes&#8230;just for now.</p>\n<p>This calm, mundane life called to me through the chill in the Winter air. Feeling the contrast of the cool that floated around me compared to the extreme heat on the sides of my mug, a burning I gladly welcomed with the dropping temperatures so early in the morning.</p>\n<p>I know they question. Those with a life so out there. Taking risks and dancing away whilst laughing in sunlight. They enjoy the chatter, the pointless banter back and forth with each other, dancing in the shallow water causing ripples to swim out.</p>\n<p>I see their curious eyes as their gaze falls upon my still form, a small, tight-lipped smile resting uncomfortably on my face.</p>\n<p>Yet another moment distracted by the waves they made&#8230;perhaps I will wait for another moment like this.</p>\n<p>Yours Truly,</p>\n<p>J.N.T</p>\n <p>Well, here I am; writing because a pandemic virus has literally taken over our lives. I can&#8217;t seem to fathom that this year will eventually be taught in schools in future history lessons.</p>\n<p>If I ever become a grandfather, I would be able to sit down on my rustic chair warming my brittle fingers with some warm tea, preaching to my grandkids that I was alive &#8220;back then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No. I wasn&#8217;t alive during the world war&#8217;s, but yes, I was alive when the world was taken captive by the deadliest virus in history. I guess it seems pretty stupid that they might also teach that this was a year my home country, Australia, fell into another one of its droughts.</p>\n<p>Except for this time, it was a toilet paper drought &#8211; providing a whole new definition for the land down under. While people are suffering in hospitals, struggling to breathe. I&#8217;m here whingeing when my next vaccination shot is going to take place.</p>\n<p>Well, if you&#8217;ve gotten this far into my rant on life in 2020. Thank you. Thank you for listening to some random person on the internet ramble on about life. I hope you are doing well. I hope you find a light in what seems to be darkness right now. I hope you are happy :)</p>\n <p>I slowly peel my eyes open as they are struggling from the lack of sleep during this quarantine, most nights I lay awake contemplating. How surreal it is, to be experiencing such a rare pandemic, almost lucky yet unlucky. At least we will have stories to tell our future children,</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mummy tell me that story about the time the world went into quarantine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel real&#8230; like an unfunny prank. They say it only feels real after you get it, but then it&#8217;s too late to go back. I close my eyes again&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m biting into a sandwich and bored out of my mind, I find myself enjoying the sandwich. I taste everything, the sweet notes of the bread, the tanginess of the cheese melting into the saltiness of my ham, the umami coating my tongue in goodness. I think quarantine is getting to me.</p>\n<p>I find myself quite cozy on the couch, getting ready to catch up on Netflix yet everything seems so quiet, I can hear the &#8216;thump&#8217; in my chest, I can feel my blood pumping through my body, I can still taste the sandwich and the juice that washed it down, I can smell the fresh air that the window is letting in.</p>\n<p>Usually I am too busy to notice these little things, but I am starting to appreciate them. Or maybe quarantine has made me go insane. I think a bit of both. Stay safe during these times x</p>\n <p>Ok so&#8230;</p>\n<p>I have a bracelet that I need to give back to my friend after she left it at my house, and this virus is being an inconvenience in letting me return it to her. Now, I promise I will refrain from mentioning this virus for the continuation of my extract because like me you&#8217;re probably sick of hearing about it.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am beginning to take the first steps toward my goals. The big one being for me to get to NSW All Schools for cross country. I know for some this may be easy but I have to go through CIS which only takes the top 10 finishers! The reason why making the top 10 is so hard is because CIS features all the independent schools, and some of these schools are the best in the state! producing exceptionally talented athletes.</p>\n<p>I am also producing a dream board for my positive psychology class. Most people may see this a bludge subject. I do too. Usually. But this dream board is different. it&#8217;s personal. And I&#8217;m finding it&#8217;s a really good way for me to find out more about myself. Letting me reset and assess where I truly want to be, without the distractions.</p>\n <p>Right now, we are all still keeping our distance, but we are allowed to go out for school and to shop for non-essential items, like shoes and clothes.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I went to school for one day a week and I got to see a few of my classmates which was good. I’m happy that I got to interact with people my age again because in my household I am the youngest person and it gets lonely sometimes.</p>\n<p>Online school was a struggle at first, but I’ve learnt a lot of new skills and problem solving. Last term, I felt like the teachers gave us way too much homework for each lesson, but luckily now we only get work at the beginning of the week.</p>\n<p>I’m getting used to online schooling now, I almost can’t imagine going back to school 5 days a week, since we’ve been in quarantine for two or three months already.</p>\n<p>I kind of don’t want to go back, because I like that I don’t have to wake up at 6am every morning and commute for an hour in a crowded train. The only reason why I want to go back to school is because I enjoy seeing my friends and face to face learning is much easier.</p>\n <p>I had a thought early this morning as I was running in an empty sports field, looking up at the super moon beaming down on me; maybe I’ve been doing it all wrong&#8230;</p>\n <p>During my time at home, I enjoyed some peace and quiet. It was nice to have a break from reality and take a step back. When school started again my first experience of remote learning was actually impressive, i was thinking about how amazing technology has come and how we can learn at home.</p>\n<p>After a week I was not enjoying remote learning, I hated having so many distractions while learning. Being able to have access to everything was extremely annoying, you could just stop working and go off and do anything was very distracting.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus ruined my holidays, although it was nice staying at home, I would&#8217;ve enjoyed going out and having a great time with my friends and family. We could&#8217;ve enjoyed going to the beach, going to swimming pools, going for bike rides and so much more.</p>\n<p>In the holidays we didn&#8217;t do much, most of the time we did stuff at home like cleaning and fixing up all the issues with the house. It wasn&#8217;t fun at all but at least I got some time to do what I like. I was gaming with my friends, riding bikes with my cousin and watching Netflix in my spare time.</p>\n<p>Overall, the holidays were average and remote learning wasn&#8217;t that great.</p>\n <p>Hey, I&#8217;m Natasha.<br />\nDuring quarantine I did many things which included: bike riding, walking my dog and spending time with her, going for bike rides, binge watching Harry Potter and MANY other shows.</p>\n<p>I facetimed SO MANY people including Mikala F one of my close friends, Niki, Bella (many of them, ahahah) olivia, rose, sophia, tom, jess, and many more. I became so much closer to my family and understand so much more about them, it sounds weird but it&#8217;s true.</p>\n<p>I appreciate having my family and my friends who I love &amp; adore; they reached out to me throughout quarantine and I really appreciate it! I did a lot of cooking (some didn&#8217;t turn out well&#8230;) and I did something very old fashioned&#8230;. I WROTE A LETTER TO MY GRANDPARENTS! I drew and coloured something for each of them and it made me feel very good.</p>\n<p>It was weird going back to school and seeing my friends, now I&#8217;m back at school I am craving to be back in my pyjamas and to eat yummy food whenever I felt like it.</p>\n<p>I was so happy to see all my teachers and friends and to have a conservation with them, it felt great! I will treasure this epidemic throughout my whole life, we are all very lucky to live in this AMAZING country, I adore everything about my life and am so grateful.</p>\n <p>This current point in time is strange. Never would I have thought I’d be experiencing a pandemic. Now, I do online learning. I don’t necessarily like it, because days are too short and I feel like I’m drowning in work, though I’m not. However, this isn’t what I’m going to ramble about, because I’m sick of hearing about Covid 19.</p>\n<p>This morning, I slept through my alarm and no one came to wake me, so I missed my first class. I made a steaming cup of Joe, forgetting to pour a small volume of almond milk. “aaah!”, I yelped after feeling the wrath of Satan unleash on my tongue. Very simply, I burnt my tongue and I’ve been enduring it.</p>\n<p>With my coffee, I decided to make toast. As I was shaking some cinnamon onto the buttered bread, a decapitation occurred. It was a gruesome crime scene! And I knew I had to conceal the accident before the police arrived. My chest filling with anxiety as I frantically cleaned up my involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p>To my luck, my mother caught me red-handed discarding the evidence. Right there and then, she interrogated me, not letting me leave until the truth was exposed. I sinned. Thinking on your feet is difficult, especially as my mother knows me well, she can tell whether it is the truth or not. I blamed my pet bird on it. I lied, claiming that the small, thirty-gram budgerigar had flown across the room to the kitchen and spilt the cinnamon. Unfortunately, he had an alibi; the cage was locked, and he was calmly staring at the bird in the mirror.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t sentenced. Just let off with a warning, to remember to vacuum the floor and apologise to the adorable creature that chirps all day long.</p>\n <p>Well, it&#8217;s certainly interesting, all the shit that&#8217;s been going on. I was just minding my own business, trying to get through year 12 like every other HSC student, and then we hit the pandemic.</p>\n<p>You know, when I said that I didn&#8217;t want to go to school anymore, this is NOT what I meant. I meant I wanted to wake up, holding my HSC in my hand and acceptance letters from universities. What I did NOT mean was to have to try to learn about the nature of light through a blur of tears, sitting at a desktop at home. What do you MEAN, dsinθ=mλ?</p>\n<p>But, there have been the plus-sides to schooling from home. Namely, Nintendogs. During English at school, I would usually be scribbling notes frantically, trying to jot down the assonance in this specific line, or the metaphysical imagery of the underlying metaphor in that. Now, I can just walk my dogs and win Nintendogs competitions. Who knew that T.S. Eliot poetry could be so fascinating?</p>\n<p>School aside, it is eerie. Walking into the retail shop that I work at on weekends, seeing the Perspex around the registers, all the signs for social distancing and aisle number restrictions, and the hand-sanitizer bottle that is legitimately tethered to the desk so that people don&#8217;t steal them.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a scary new world, and I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re going to be left when this all blows over. The losses are inconceivable, and the world will genuinely not be the same after this, and I&#8217;m not saying that to be a dramatic dystopian protagonist.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ever truly going to go back to normal, at least not when this is in living memory. Even when it&#8217;s not, it should serve as a warning. Beware of the 20&#8217;s.</p>\n <p>I cut my hair the other night. I mean, why not? I&#8217;m only going to see my classmates, and that&#8217;s only one or two days a week.</p>\n<p>Staring at the chunks of hair that I had haphazardly hacked off laying in the sink was somewhat otherworldly. I know, consciously, it wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal, but I&#8217;ve never cut my own hair before, apart from when I used to do it in year 4 in class. I don&#8217;t really have to leave the house that much, so I can do anything I want with my appearance, and I wouldn&#8217;t be judged.</p>\n<p>Even on the days that I do see my peers, everyone has been going a little crazy, so there wouldn&#8217;t be that much judgement anyway. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of fresh hair bleaches and dyes.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all going to look a little feral when this all blows over, perhaps feral in all the colours of the rainbow.</p>\n <p>So over the email barrages telling me all the things I can do/should do in iso.</p>\n<p>My day today (D[isability]1 etc &#8211; regular daily medical procedure): up early (D1), fed birds (and me), logged into work, checked on my students -few posts to cheer/prod them;</p>\n<p>(D2) replied to an annoying email from some staff moaning about slack students not participating &#8211; of course they are like me &#8211; sitting on the couch binging on DVDS! Reality is some don&#8217;t have the equipment they need, or reliable access, or are trying to work with five other people in the house also working online on Zoom, or are in the queue outside Centrelink, or scrounging for food and essentials. Some on campus staff need a reality check.</p>\n<p>(D3) Treated and rebandaged the ulcer on my husband&#8217;s leg; tried to cheer up a friend having surgery tomorrow &#8211; she&#8217;s a long way from home and worried about her kids.</p>\n<p>(D4) Had a haircut up the road;</p>\n<p>(D5) drove to my mother-in-law&#8217;s nursing home to drop off/pick up her washing &#8211; 2 hour round trip. She&#8217;s fretting, so going back tomorrow for a 30 minute visit;</p>\n<p>(D6) did the washing straight away to return it then; thought about sneaking her some cheese. Maybe not. Made lunch; set the robotic vacuum cleaner going (she&#8217;s called Wally &#8211; can&#8217;t always find her);</p>\n<p>(D7) did some research work; checked my course again; brought in the washing; ordered some sewing equipment online after trawling through lots of useless sites; reported a scam to Scamwatch,</p>\n<p>(D8) cup of tea, read article about Kant&#8217;s &#8216;ought implies can&#8217; principle, tried to download Covid app again &#8211; still can&#8217;t! Am I &#8216;blameworthy&#8217;? Depends on interpretation of his Principle of Alternative Possibilities (seriously???).</p>\n<p>(D9) Cooking dinner.</p>\n<p>D10 at bedtime. No time! Sorry.</p>\n <p>So life continues. How have I spent the last few days</p>\n<p>Well to start &#8211; Mother&#8217;s Day was VERY special. Three of my four physically here. Just being together.</p>\n<p>Running around and enjoying our absolutely delicious granddaughter! That&#8217;s a highlight. We walk her to the Opera House through our Botanic Gardens &#8211; and every time I hit that bend where the Opera House comes into absolute clear focus I hold my breath. The line and definition &#8211; it really is fabulous. We know about all the problems inside &#8211; but that aside, it&#8217;s so right that it&#8217;s one of the modern wonders of the world.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve made sourdough &#8211; successfully &#8211; and focaccia &#8211; not so successfully! But I&#8217;m cooking on an inherited Aga &#8211; with a mind of its own. I have no control at all!</p>\n<p>That glass of wine at the end of the day is welcome &#8211; and we&#8217;re all ready then for downtime after time individually spent working or running around.</p>\n<p>I seem to have ants in my pants &#8211; not finding it easy to settle and give myself that luxurious permission to just &#8216;be&#8217; &#8211; and read! I still seem to need to be busy.</p>\n<p>One observation &#8211; quite off on a tangent now &#8211; when we walk in Rushcutter&#8217;s Bay Park it&#8217;s a completely different social dynamic than walking through the Gardens. Extraordinary! Not NEARLY so engaging and friendly. The experience for me has &#8216;attitude&#8217;! Extraordinary I know&#8230;</p>\n<p>So now to watch STC&#8217;s weekly offering &#8211; behind the scenes watching the actors in rehearsal for Hedda Gabler a few years ago.</p>\n<p>I have other things to share &#8211; and will continue to do so&#8230;..</p>\n <p>In 2020 we learned how to not hug. It was something strange for us humans. Always tactile, needing to embrace, and suddenly one day it stopped.</p>\n<p>We learned how to social distance, which was strange at first. Separate yet bound by a collective experience.</p>\n<p>The slogans and propaganda were fast. “Stay at home, stay safe, save lives&#8230; download the app, get vaxed, we are all in this together&#8230;”</p>\n<p>We listened. We obeyed. We complied, like the good human beings that we are</p>\n<p>Once upon a time the world was normal. Now it’s not&#8230;.</p>\n<p>The End.</p>\n <p>Mother’s Day! A early morning tray of tea, and gifts of pickled eggplant &amp; piccalilli plus handmade soap from Lyttleton’s Store in Lawson, alongside fresh freesias from the garden, a handmade card &amp; a poem from Miss 8.<br />\nM was sheepish about the lockdown gifts but they made me laugh, and actually I quite liked it all.</p>\n<p>Afterwards we drove to Wentworth Falls, 15 mins up the mountain, bought takeaway coffee &amp; hot chocolates and sat hugging them on street benches in the sunshine and cold. Then my son, F, and I walked to the lake to meet our bird-watching friends while M and Miss 8 went looking for the ingredients for tonight’s fish pie. We’ll call it Pirate’s Pie for our daughter, who is not keen on eating animals and is put off by specifics.</p>\n<p>At the lake we met our friends — social distancing observed — and delighted in a small pied cormorant, 4 little black cormorants, a selection of honeyeaters, thornbills (which we heard but didn’t see) and a pair of brooding galahs. Local wildlife artist, Fiona Lumsden, taught us how to spot mistletoe growing on indigenous trees as a parasite. It is good for the birds, and draws migrating species to the lake for food.</p>\n<p>John the photographer mentioned having a cake bake-off via Facebook this afternoon with a friend, a very good baker. Back home I was inspired to bake fudge brownies made with black beans instead of flour. You’d never know the difference. Usually.</p>\n<p>Things didn&#8217;t go quite to plan. The tray I selected was too big and I forgot the baking powder, so they were a little … okay, a lot… flat. Tasted good enough to have with afternoon tea though!</p>\n <p>I spent today amusing myself by writing this list. Hope it amuses you also.</p>\n<p>KNOW YOUR ACRONYNMS IN THESE MODERN TIMES<br />\nPMS Pasta Making Shortage<br />\nCBD Covid Boredom Disorder<br />\nTPG Toilet Paper Gone<br />\nPTSD Pasta and Tissue Shortage Disorder<br />\nNDIS No Dettol In Stock<br />\nMD Mask Denier (as in Brendan Murphy MD)<br />\nNRMA No Remaining Masks Available<br />\nRAC Royals Affected by Covid<br />\nQLD Quarantine Loneliness Disorder<br />\nNSW No Shortage of Whingers<br />\nVIC Very Infective Covid<br />\nTAS Take A Shower (as in keep calm)<br />\nHSC Hand Sanitiser for Covid<br />\nDVD Damn Viral Disease<br />\nDFAT Damn Fat (How I’m gettin’ sitting at home)<br />\nPGH Please Go Home<br />\nSAS Support A Senior (Launched today by Anastasia P)</p>\n<p>WHO When the Hurt’s Over<br />\nNBN No Bloody Network<br />\nABC All ‘Bout Covid</p>\n<p>And a new one..<br />\nESS Empty Shelf Syndrome</p>\n<p>HELPFUL HINTS<br />\nToilet Paper Substitutes:<br />\nPhone Books<br />\nThose otherwise useless letters that politicians send you<br />\nAny Murdoch publication<br />\nPasta substitute<br />\nAny of the above &#8211; roll tightly, cut into short lengths and steam.</p>\n<p>TODAY’S OBSERVATIONS<br />\nThe Federal govt is going to subsidise export flights for fish.

I liked the idea because I would be able to stay at home and basically do nothing until the next day they introduce online class.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t mind for the first week and then I realised that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to leave my house or see my friends. I finally realised that quarantine was really boring.</p>\n<p>Term 2 came and I realised we were going back to school in week 3 but we weren&#8217;t allowed to play sport with others and had to stay away from others. I was supposed to have my first school basketball tournament but I knew it would be cancelled.</p>\n <p>당신에게 착륙 충돌<br />\n이태원 수업<br />\n호텔 델 루나<br />\n라 카사 데 파펠<br />\n타이거 킹</p>\n<p>These are all the Netflix series I watched&#8230;</p>\n <p>It was February 2020 Sydney, eshays and bogans were roaming the streets of Sydney, TikTok was the cool trend going on (even though it was horrible), People were flexing iPhone 11&#8217;s and Rolex&#8217;s and the most terrible songs of music&#8217;s history we&#8217;re going viral.</p>\n<p>But there was something else that hit the world. A particular virus called COVID-19 or CORONAVIRUS. It was a deadly flu that strongly affected lungs and was a dangerous fever. People thought that it was an epidemic that would die soon. But, by March 2020, it became a pandemic.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of people died. Everyone was rushing to Coles and Woolworth&#8217;s to get toilet paper and deserting the shop shelves. People were going for their lives for hand sanitiser and toilet paper.</p>\n<p>Mid-April 2020, all schools in Sydney starting working from home/online. Kids were invading their fridges and skipping school work. Earth was like hell. </p>\n<p>Now is the beginning of May 2020 and I am back at school. COVID-19 is a once in a lifetime pandemic. I will never look at the toilet paper and hand sanitiser the same way again.</p>\n <p>Wassup my lad my name is Natalia and I am 12 years old and I am here to tell you about life at home in isolation. It has been a rough start to the year with the Coronavirus. Online schooling was really hard with work that I was behind on sometimes that would drive me crazy. It was hard to work when there is no one to kind of help you with your work because parents and siblings have to catch up with work too. 2020 has been a rough year but we are back at school now to learn.</p>\n <p>Dear person from the future&#8230;.So, the year is 2120 and you are wondering how life was for ordinary Australians a hundred years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. I work in an office job and most people usually drive a car or catch a bus to work in Canberra. Since the virus outbreak I have been working from home since 30 March 2020. I am sitting at home using my computer at the dinner table instead. I can access all the same information here that I can at my desk at the office. </p>\n<p>In 2020 we use technology called WiFi (stands for Wireless Fidelity). It is reasonably new (an Australian invention!)and has only been around for less than 20 years. I live in a 4 bedroom house on a quarter acre of land about 20 kilometres from the city centre. Petrol costs $1 per litre and there are no autonomous vehicles &#8211; cars are always driven my humans. The only time I leave the house is to go to the supermarket to buy groceries. There are so many people wanting groceries to be delivered to their home, the supermarkets cannot cope with demand and have cancelled deliveries. </p>\n<p>I wear a face mask and I carry hand sanitiser with me. Until last weekend I had not seen my family since the first week of March. I miss my colleagues from work. Talking to an image of someone on a 2 dimensional screen (we use computer programs called SKYPE or ZOOM or MICROSOFT TEAMS) is not the same as meeting them in person. My only advice to the person in 2120 reading this&#8230;be thankful for what you have. Life can change in an instant and you don&#8217;t appreciate what you have until it is gone. </p>\n <p>Covid-19</p>\n<p>My life before Covid-19 was typical, go to school, come back to relax, then homework, TV and bed. This pandemic changed my life in ways i couldn&#8217;t imagine, not seeing my friends and family, doing sport, even social interaction.</p>\n<p>My family is super important and not seeing them was really hard. Seeing my friends through Face-Time and Zoom was good but it wasn&#8217;t the same as learning and having fun during lunch and recess.</p>\n<p>This time has made me grateful for my life and how we have a fighting chance at life unlike those who have the disease. One of the best times has been talking and zooming with family and friends about their time during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>TV has helped me through this time with The Good Place, Friends, Seinfield,  The Flash and  The Next Step. I also played a game called Minecraft which was fun and filled time when i was bored. </p>\n<p>I was happy when school was called back on because homeschooling was quite tough, but it helped me connect with people i normally wouldn&#8217;t of if the pandemic never happened. This might have been bad for some but also important for my family and our roots.</p>\n <p>A Letter to My Friends</p>\n<p>My dear friends,<br />\nI may not always tell you, and you may not always realise, how very precious you are to me.<br />\nFrom those who have been in my life for many years, to those who have just danced in for a while and then out again, hopefully to return.<br />\nYou keep me sane and focused. You are wise, funny, judgemental and at times just downright annoying.<br />\nYou offer advice, entertain me, teach me, care for me, love me, and, on occasion, send me emergency chocolate packages and marijuana cigarettes. Thank you for all those gifts.<br />\nI sometimes feel that I am a diminutive figure standing in a battle field with my sword raised in my shaky hand; then I glance behind me and there you all are, smiling and waiting to support me.<br />\nBuddha says &#8220;to be strong you have to learn to fight alone&#8221;.<br />\nI know I don&#8217;t need to.<br />\nI miss you and would like nothing more than to take you in my arms and say &#8220;I love you all&#8221;.</p>\n <p>Second day of the shop being open, after seven weeks of not letting the public in. Funny watching people enter; we have hand sanitiser and a polite note at the doors asking people to use it. Some do, with great show -look at me! I do the right thing! &#8211; some use it matter-of-factly, because afterall it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing for weeks &#8211; some look at it askance. I watched one man just wave his hands at it &#8211; the art of magical thinking? And even after so long that social distancing should be second nature, people still stand elbow to elbow browsing the books, even though there&#8217;s plenty of room to spread out. It&#8217;s like catching the train; sometimes you can be the only one in the compartment, but half the time when a new person gets on, they sit opposite you&#8230;the other half do the calculation: what is the furthest I can sit from those already seated? A new form of social maths!</p>\n<p>The city is slightly busier. It&#8217;s not quite the tumbleweed-blowing-through-emptiness of a month or so ago. A few more shops are open in the QVB and in the Pitt St mall, more people wandering round. Maybe not as aimlessly as pre-covid19 &#8211; window-shopping is rare these days &#8211; but not as furtively as it seemed last month, when &#8216;scuttle&#8217; rather than &#8216;saunter&#8217; seemed the pace of necessity. Now the feeling seems to have slipped from alarm to alert, even though we may not be at a stage where we should be casual. People are still falling sick with this viral disease; but I guess we are all feeling sick of it&#8230;</p>\n <p>I am an older woman living alone in what is generally known as a &#8216;California bungalow&#8217;.  Before the Corona virus I led a busy life, belonging to several organisations such as U3A, and including a performance group run by the Older Women&#8217;s Network.  I used to sometimes ponder how I would cope if I could no longer get out and about. To my surprise I am enjoying social isolation.  </p>\n<p>I still go out to buy food and medications but, like everyone else at present, I have no social life.  Instead I read, write cards, phone people, do puzzles, tidy cupboards, sort through papers, join Zoom meetings, answer emails and do gardening.  Yes, I am lucky enough to have a garden. I know the weeds will take over in the end but I find pulling them out very satisfying. </p>\n<p>I really enjoy having a leisurely breakfast and not having to rush to get somewhere, and I enjoy being able to read for pleasure without feeling I should be doing something more &#8216;useful&#8217;.  What I am missing are hugs and back rubs, physical contact. Also having lunch and a glass of wine somewhere with a friend, or even the ritual of a cup of coffee in a café while reading the paper. </p>\n <p>When coronavirus strikes we all split to our sides. Some fighting for their freedom and some fighting for the future of our population.</p>\n<p>Hitting us back into reality is the harsh truth and effect that some actions cause. Whether we protest, confess or request for help. All are suffering in different ways, however, the path we take or the actions we make can even change the slightest things.</p>\n<p>What has now become our iconic chant, to wash our hands, sanitise, put on a mask and social distance. Those who need assistance are assisted and aided by the many who still social distance. </p>\n<p>Those on the frontlines, helping and saving us, thank you! </p>\n<p>Thank you for helping us even though there&#8217;s distance, thank you for your persistence and thank you for your existence.</p>\n <p>All my family is well, safe and happy despite the turmoil of the past couple of years. </p>\n<p>1) We had a very severe drought for about two years<br />\n2) Then devastating bush fires all along our east coast from<br />\n    Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane. Many lives lost, much property<br />\n    destroyed and a lot of wild life wiped out.<br />\n3) Now the virus </p>\n<p>As they say all things come in threes. So now there are three good news happenings on the horizon. Actually four.</p>\n<p>1) Australia is fairing very well with the virus.<br />\n2) We have excellent governments &#8211; local, state and federal.<br />\n3) We have a relatively small low density population.<br />\n4) Even though our population is multicultural there is very little<br />\n    racial or religious conflict. Almost everyone has taken the<br />\n    governments directions very seriously. We hope to be virus free<br />\n    this year.</p>\n <p>Over four billion years ago earth’s first sunrise dawned,<br />\nnot long after that the oceans formed.</p>\n<p>Deep, deep down in the cold dark,<br />\nSomething stirred, the very first spark.</p>\n<p>Fuelled by superhot hydrothermal vents,<br />\nThis thing we know as life commenced.</p>\n<p>All creatures came from that water,<br />\nEvery son, every daughter.</p>\n<p>She can create life… and as easily take it away again,<br />\nas her storms destroy the work of men.</p>\n<p>She is beauty, she is power,<br />\nShe gives me fish and chips and a nice hot shower.</p>\n<p>She gives us the cooling breezes, she gives us fun,<br />\nShe gives us holidays and laughter in the sun.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all good, not all fantastic,<br />\nShe’s drowning in a sea of plastic.</p>\n<p>The biggest threat she’s ever faced<br />\nIs that we keep filling her with our waste.</p>\n<p>What if she tires or her power starts to fail?<br />\nWill she live on, or will she give up and set sail?</p>\n<p>But today there’s a fresh swell and more waves came,<br />\nI love that she’s always changing, never the same.</p>\n<p>Pink zinc on, sleepy eyes still crusty,<br />\nI walk to the beach past cars her breath turns rusty.</p>\n<p>She has the power to take away my sadness,<br />\nto help me escape this COVID madness.</p>\n<p>Surfing is my happy place,<br />\nas she wraps me in her salty embrace.</p>\n <p>Where would we be without Zoom?<br />\nI zoom my family<br />\nI zoom my friends<br />\nI zoom at work<br />\nI zoom my choir<br />\nand I have even attended a Zoom birthday party.</p>\n<p>I reckon some of this zooming may actually stick.  For instance, my family is interstate and overseas, so I love catching up with my extended family on the weekend and seeing everyones faces.</p>\n<p>There has been talk that Zoom is not a secure platform.  The question is &#8230; what is secure?  We are vulnerable but somehow we have to stay connected.    </p>\n <p>A beam of joy has shone down into Stone Place. This is the home of the Bears of Stone Place. </p>\n<p>These are no ordinary Bears. Every day for the past 6 weeks they have played, created, performed, celebrated and entertained. They have reminded us to keep active, to create, learn new skills, be quiet, help each other and have a bit of fun. Above all they have brought something you cannot buy, smiles!</p>\n<p>My 95 year old uncle looks forward to the bears email every morning, often making silly suggestions about their activities. It gives him something else to think about while he is stuck at home. My grandchildren phone up and ask “What are the teddies doing today Nan?” Friends send back humorous images of their teddies up to no good and the neighbourhood children and families walk past looking out to see what they are up to.</p>\n<p>When ‘ordinary’ returns and bear hunts are forgotten, I will miss this daily ritual of putting out the bears as it has helped me feel connected to family, friends and neighbours in this period of aloneness.<br />\nYou can follow their daily pursuits on their blog<br />\nhttps://thebearsofstoneplace.blogspot.com</p>\n <p>As a  health professional working in a hospital setting this pandemic stuff has been full on!</p>\n<p>First of all&#8230; I just want to say thank you to everyone for doing the social isolation (SI) thing, you really saved us.  This period of SI has given us a chance to be prepared.<br />\nWe have planned for COVID,<br />\npracticed our donning and doffing,<br />\nrefreshed our critical care skills,<br />\ncounted our masks and respirators&#8230; and now feel better prepared to face COVID.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to the community who have really supported us and made us feel like heroes.  In reality we think the community are the heroes, they have done it tough at home, lost jobs and home schooled their kids.  At least we have been able to go to work.</p>\n<p>If we stick together we can beat it. </p>\n <p>A change of pace, and a quiet day at the practice. Time to catch up on the results, letters, and check in on the phone with my regulars. It&#8217;s nice that Medicare now pays for these services. A smattering of patients. Some uncertain bleeding. She&#8217;s a well woman by my socially distanced eyeball test &#8211; though she probably can&#8217;t see my eyeballs so easily. Glove and gown and the exam confirms she&#8217;ll be fine. </p>\n<p>Later, handing me the signed urine form, her finger brushes over my washed un-gloved fingertip. Ridged, spongy, warm sensations all so distinct in the fraction of a second. She&#8217;s not so used to monitoring every object in sight, touched, untouched, dirty end of the counter, clean side of the trolley. I surprise myself in that moment finding I&#8217;m not annoyed but attuned to my fingertip, now contaminated. How awful. How awesome. It&#8217;s been an age since I touched skin without gloves, and so I&#8217;m left not only reassuring her that the urine test tells us the miracle of life is not a differential we need to consider today, but reassuring myself that it&#8217;s still there, right at my fingertip.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m feeling very happy tonight, even while I&#8217;m still self isolating at home.  My local choir, Kala Rava, has just finished our fortnightly online Zoom meeting for this evening.  It&#8217;s more fun when we can get together physically at the local hall, but we aren&#8217;t allowed to gather in person, so at the start of the &#8220;lockdown&#8221; Marie our choir leader organised for us to meet online every 2 weeks.  </p>\n<p>I really look forward to catching up with my choir friends and seeing their faces.  Even though it&#8217;s only 1.25 hours of singing and connecting with others it really makes a difference to my mood.  I&#8217;m happy when I can sing with the choir.  It&#8217;s important to stay connected during these isolating times, know that everyone else is still there and it gives me something to look forward to.  I feel very happy and grateful to have these other people in my life and I look forward to seeing them all again in person &#8211; hopefully not too far off.</p>\n<p>After the singing is over, it&#8217;s time to reflect upon how important it is to have music and singing in my life and to have friends to enjoy it with.</p>\n<p>The Zoom technology is great.  Sitting in front of my laptop computer I can add a backdrop of one of my own photos and then the camera in the laptop shows me in front of my photo.  I change the photo each week and enjoy seeing other people&#8217;s photos.  We can all see each other while we listen to the music and sing along.  It&#8217;s different singing this way but definitely better than not meeting at all. </p>\n <p>Time away from school is supposed to be fun, enjoyable and just relaxing. This time away from school was deadly, life-threatening and terrifying. To live in the time of a huge pandemic is a memory I will never forget, hand sanitiser with me everywhere I go, no hugs, less and less human interaction. How long will it last? How long will we have to suffer? When, when will it end? These are questions we ask, when and how, asking for this pandemic to end. But we forget what matters.</p>\n<p>What about all this time we have to spend quality time with our families? The baking, the bike riding, the card games and the board games. This is how we are impacted by this large pandemic, but not all is bad as you see. I&#8217;m sure you all have had some great times at home. Just keep in mind, bad isn&#8217;t all bad, we have some highs to staying home. We have to remember what keeps us going in times like these, our families, our friends, our teachers, our classmates, just some of these people can make an impact in our lives whether we see them or not. </p>\n<p>Yes, ups and downs come around and sometimes they aren&#8217;t as large as this one, but we&#8217;ve got to keep in mind that it will pass, human research and development will grow, so don&#8217;t freak out about all of these ban things happening and try to remember all of the good things instead. Overall, we want to fight this, we can fight this, we will fight this. Remember, we will always have someone with us no matter what, whether it&#8217;s a parent, sibling, cousin, friend, classmate or teacher, they know what you&#8217;re going through and together you will fight trough it.</p>\n <p>The very part about all this is 100% the memes. The internet really pulled itself together when faced with this shite and its honestly what has kept me sane. </p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not even on tiktok.</p>\n <p>Well life has certainly been a little different over the last two months with COVID 19.  People are working from home, children are being home schooled via online methods and there is little social interaction.  We are spending more time at home and only leaving for exercise, shopping for groceries, medical appointments and little else.  I have two children, a five year old and a nine year old.  They do miss being able to visit playgrounds (as they are closed) and seeing their friends.  We have done lots more bike rides and playing in the backyard, also playing board games.  Both my children are looking forward to going back to the school for lessons.  They miss the school environment and even though they see their teacher and classmates online it is not the same as physically being at school.  </p>\n<p>We are grateful that we have been safe, have had plenty of good food to eat and have a secure home to live in.  This global pademic could have been a lot worse but to be honest whilst things are different and there are inconveniences we feel that as a family and a society in general we have been very fortunate.  We are sad for those that have lost their lives to the virus and we hope that Australia continues to manage the virus so that less people are affected.</p>\n <p>G&#8217;day. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I ever wrote to myself. I mean, last time I did this type of thing was when I had to write to myself everyday because I was told to let my mum know what was going on last year.</p>\n<p>It was my brother&#8217;s birthday yesterday and we had a miniature party. We played pass the parcel and we did a pinata, which I beheaded. But it wasn&#8217;t exciting, since at the party, it was just me, my brothers, my mum and my dad. My brother loves Mariokart, so I got him a Mariokart Hot Wheels track. He loves it.</p>\n<p>The last 2 months have been a bit confusing for me. For example, the last time i went to school apart from last Monday, everyone was on the verge of murdering me. It wasn&#8217;t until I went on to Quotev when everyone revealed that everyone wanting to kill me was a prank. I don&#8217;t know whether to believe them or not. Because, my friend, Katie said that she wanted me to die and then yesterday she revealed that after a few weeks she decided she was tired of getting angry at me and wanted to be friends again. You can tell that things have been a bit confusing.</p>\n<p>Well, I best be going now, I mean I did just spend most of my English class writing this. I actually need to do some other work now.</p>\n<p>Until Next time,</p>\n <p>El Periplo de la Muerte</p>\n<p>¿A dónde crees que vas, Corona, de la mano de la Muerte…?</p>\n<p>Tu viaje por nuestro planeta pronto llegará a su fin.

Y el mundo sonreirá de nuevo. Y las tormentas, y las aguas revueltas, volverán a calmarse.

En estos momentos yo le siento correr por las venas. Algo inesperado me ha ocurrido esta mañana.</p>\n<p>Apenas me he despertado he recordado una canción de los años 70 que fue mi preferida por un tiempo, y he buscado el disco, que aún conservo. </p>\n<p>Hermosa pop-song, interpretada por Allison Durbin. Hermosa pop-song, aquí resumida, pero el mensaje está claro:</p>\n<p>Put your hand&#8230;</p>\n<p>Put your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nwho stilled the water,<br />\nput your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nwho calmed the sea.<br />\nTake a look at yourself<br />\nand you can look at others differently,<br />\nput your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nfrom Galilee.<br />\nMy momma taught me how to pray<br />\nbefore I reached the age of seven,<br />\nand when I&#8217;m down on my knees<br />\nthat&#8217;s when I&#8217;m closest to Heaven.<br />\nPut your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nwho stilled the water,<br />\nput your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nwho calmed the sea.<br />\nPut your hand in the hand of the man<br />\nfrom Galilee.<br />\nOh yeah!</p>\n <p>During my time at home I went on a lot of walks and I did around 3-8 km every day and I would walk to my local supermarket or I would go to Olds Park and do laps of the AFL oval.</p>\n<p>Some days being at home got boring but i just had to find something to entertain myself with, whether it be my Ipad , my Phone and I even painted something with fun colours and patterns but I always found something to do.</p>\n<p>School hasn&#8217;t been super hard but i have missed all my friends, but I loved how I didn&#8217;t have to worry about what time I would have to go to bed or what time I had to get up in the morning. I could just take my time to get settled into my work and i didn&#8217;t have to worry about homework because I had done it all in my school time. I found remote learning fun and enjoyable, it wasn&#8217;t the best thing in the world but it wasn&#8217;t horrible.</p>\n<p>Overall i found learning from home fun and relaxing.</p>\n<p>by Mia Vais</p>\n <p>I haven&#8217;t ironed a shirt, had a haircut, or shaved my face since March. </p>\n <p>I decided to use the time to grow a beard.</p>\n<p>In my mind it would possibly look like the beards of the Czar and his cousin the King when they were photographed together prior to the First World War.</p>\n<p>I have never had one before, just a daily smudge of rough shadow that appears each afternoon, and a few days stubble most weekends.</p>\n<p>Prior to now I hadn&#8217;t considered letting a beard grow. The scruffy period before it would be fully formed would look like neglect, and that just wouldn&#8217;t do.</p>\n<p>After 3 weeks my beard is quite full, spiky, dark in parts and streaked with grey. It doesn’t look like I had imagined, rather I am a slightly wolfish version of myself.</p>\n<p>I’ve checked it from a few angles and I think it would look acceptable in public. Having said that, I’m not entirely convinced so I don’t think it will last.</p>\n <p>Covid 19 has affected me in many ways. For me I think there&#8217;s been more good than bad. Honestly, I was working at home for school and that didn&#8217;t really affect me any badly. Now I&#8217;m back but it was actually very nice spending more time with my family.</p>\n<p>But it has been a bit of a bummer that I can&#8217;t really see anyone else but it&#8217;s getting better now that I can see some of my other family. In my view, Australia has benefited from this and are actually having less deaths because less people are getting the flu and there are less car accidents.</p>\n<p>The government is bringing things along pretty fast and there may even be some more outbreaks and I may even have to go back to working from home.</p>\n<p>This has been a global pandemic and it saddens me just looking at other countries seeing that so many people are dying. I know nobody that has actually got coronavirus so I&#8217;m very lucky there, and I hope none of my family will get it, fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>I hope someone sees this entry in the future and I hope everything gets better. Covid has been a once in a lifetime experience and it has rocked the world back and forth.</p>\n <p>The Slow Lane</p>\n<p>It is gloomy again, hard to tease the sun out this Autumn, camellias are blooming without a care. I wonder if I should get out of bed for another at home, nothing day. Find it difficult to get excited about the anything, not like before.</p>\n<p>   Discipline is the best. Routine. This virus has infected my brain, my ability to hope and visualise the new order the new good day. I crawl out of bed, dress and make a strong coffee. Now I am better, much better. </p>\n<p>   How things have changed, now little things matter. Before I could spend a day without combing my hair, now it is important, without it I am not ready. Maybe I&#8217;ll even wear a flower in my hair. </p>\n<p>   I made a promise, bet with friends that we&#8217;d dress every morning, comb our hair, put on lipstick and smile for a little while at least.</p>\n<p>Today I will wear a pink Camelia in my hair.</p>\n<p>It helps me ease into another isolation day in the studio, where words are hammered into shape and paintings emerge. </p>\n<p>Suddenly it is ok. COVID, you and I have made an unquiet peace; for now anyway.</p>\n <p>Right now we are in the middle of a pandemic and it&#8217;s changing the way everyone lives.</p>\n<p>First, everything was shut or cancelled which made everything seem worse because there wasn&#8217;t a lot to do other than stay at home. It started to get better and things started to open up and we can finally see some of our friends again.</p>\n<p>NRL is starting again so there&#8217;s finally something to watch on TV and sports might start again.</p>\n<p>While staying at home I&#8217;ve been wondering what everything will be like when all of this is over and even in the future. Is everything back to &#8216;normal&#8217;? Is anyone scared that something like this will happen again? What&#8217;s the most popular sport at the moment? Has anything happened in the world that&#8217;s significant? What&#8217;s the latest trend? They&#8217;re a bit random but maybe something interesting will happen in years to come.</p>\n<p>Easter and Mother&#8217;s Day weren&#8217;t the same as they usually are and we couldn&#8217;t see some of our family. Lots of things will be different when everything is over. I&#8217;m just waiting for the day when we can go out and play sport and see all of our friends again without having restrictions.</p>\n <p>The time during COVID19, was quite a time because we were to do remote learning online, while living in isolation and to excercise everyday while avoiding people on the same street.</p>\n<p>Working from was quite stressful at sometimes because if you don&#8217;t quite know what the teacher is asking you to do for the task, you have to email your teacher, and if the teacher does not email back straight away, you have are left with nothing to do.</p>\n<p>But on the bright side, being at home was a relaxing time, and we got to take a break from going from point A to B and then back. It was also nice not having to rush to go to school everyday, but instead we were doing it at home.</p>\n<p>Because we are in isolation, my sports were cancelled, the training and the competitive games on the weekend, which I miss. Being in isolation, gives us time to catch up on whatever we were falling behind in, and catching up in sports, by learning new skills. Even though my sports were cancelled, I would go for one hour walks everyday with my family and then maybe 5 days a week, we would go to our local park to play soccer.</p>\n<p>I think COVID19 has a positive side, and a negative side. The positive side is that people get to be with their families, and some families that maybe don&#8217;t see one of their family member often, get to see each other. The negative side of COVID19 is that the population has tremendously decreased in size and lots of people have lost their family members.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, COVID19 was good and bad in its own ways.</p>\n <p>COVID-19 has allowed me to reflect on myself and my family- specifically to spend more time with them as due to schoolwork and assignments, I cannot spend much time with them. However, through quarantine and social isolation, I have been able to spend more time with them.</p>\n<p>However, there were the downsides where we were encouraged to stay indoors to allow the spread of COVID-19 to slow. Staying home wasn&#8217;t a big deal for me since I was already quite the homebody, however, even for me as a homebody was hard to cope without socialising with my friends.</p>\n<p>During the school holidays, I&#8217;d usually go out places with my friends to catch up, however, this holidays I couldn&#8217;t due to the strict measures put into place.</p>\n<p>With quarantine and isolation having both its negative and positives points, as a 14 y/o, I knew this experience would never come again, so I tried to make the best of it during this time.</p>\n <p>During this time of the national pandemic everything became hard for the people of the world.</p>\n<p>In my life I am pressured to keep up with school work and not fall behind but to me that wasn&#8217;t as important as my health and the health of my family. I keep thinking to myself and praying that my grandparents are safe and that their health is something that they are worrying about more than anything else.</p>\n<p>I wonder, when is this going to end but in a way I don&#8217;t really want it to end because I don&#8217;t have to go to school. All around the world there are signs of anxiousness, people are stocking up and it only feels like a few days ago that people in Australia where panicking and stocking up on toilet paper and I thought to myself who would stock up on toilet paper. How&#8217;s that going to help you with a global pandemic.</p>\n <p>Living through this Covid-19 pandemic has been challenging, but it does have some positives. Being in self isolation and not being allowed to go many places has been hard, I miss my friends, my family, my school, my netball studio and my dance studio.</p>\n<p>A member of my family has recently had her new born baby girl, I would really like to thank all of the doctors and nurses that helped her through, even during this pandemic.</p>\n<p>I am currently back at school, this has been really enjoyable as I am able to see my teachers and friends.</p>\n<p>Some positive aspects of this pandemic are that our pollution levels have dropped dramatically, we are now all realising how much pollution we actually put out there.</p>\n<p>On Friday, we get to have 5 people over and have a gathering of up to 10 people! I can&#8217;t wait to have my friends over!</p>\n<p>So many people have passed away during this pandemic, my heart goes out to all of those families suffering from loss.</p>\n<p>Love, Amelia x</p>\n <p>I am 69 years young, and hope to have many more.</p>\n<p>We have just celebrated Mothers Day, I have four adult daughters, all married. It&#8217;s been hard not seeing them over the past few months, but through texting and Facetime we have kept in touch. It has made me realise how lucky I am to have them all living reasonably close in the same State, how hard must it be for those whose families live interstate or overseas.</p>\n<p>I am thankful for the technology we have today to keep us informed of each days events, although sometimes I need to turn the TV off the news for a lighter more entertaining programme.</p>\n<p>My knitting and craft have kept me busy, but as usual we still have the everyday chores to do as well. My knitting group keep in touch everyday and check up with each other and send encouraging messages and photos of what we have been working on.</p>\n<p>My husband is an Amateur Radio operator and has set up a Morning Coffee Net each day to check in with his radio club mates and any other amateurs who might be on air to check they are ok.</p>\n<p>Today is more thought provoking, looking back on family photos and thinking how I should put them in an album. Looking at unfinished projects, and starting new ones, like remodelling my pantry.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t particularly found it hard staying at home, but do miss everyone. I am thankful for all the government officials, hospital staff for their work for all those in need. What is to come we do not know, but we need to keep hopeful for a better future, even better than before.</p>\n <p>As an Australian Muslim woman of Lebanese heritage, the Corona virus has meant confronting my fears of existential loneliness. I have been living alone after getting divorced in 2019. I chose to live alone because I value my freedom, space and privacy. And yet, this choice, like all choices in life is fraught with beauty and pain.</p>\n<p>I went from spending 90% of my time out &#8211; gym, three times a week, being part of two writing collectives, working full-time, studying one day a week, seeing family and friends and dating to being confined in my granny flat in Yagoona with my cat for daily company.</p>\n<p>Since being confined at home, I have found myself ruminating on old fears of being alone and going through highs and lows. But I want to share some achievements because this is part of my self-care. What have I done since being confined at home?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I wrote an article that will be published shortly, my first paid and published work in a long time.</li>\n<li> I tried to make a sourdough starter and ended up binning it because I am pretty sure that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s meant to smell.</li>\n<li>I started a resin river table DIY project that is still ongoing.</li>\n<li>I lead a virtual Zumba session in a large work meeting to remind myself and others to stay active for our mental health and to remember to have fun.</li>\n<li>I featured in a work podcast reflecting on what I am doing to stay passionate while working from home.</li>\n<li>I made chocolate smash balls for Eid.</li>\n<li>I cooked a Ramadan feast for my boyfriend and his friends.</li>\n<li>I reached out to my lovely counsellor.</li>\n<li>I hosted my friends for iftaar and coloured my friend&#8217;s hair green.</li>\n</ol>\n <p>The past few months have been a train wreck! There has been no socialising with friends, lots of restrictions, no going out and most of all no toilet paper. If you want me to be honest, I thought the world was going to end before we all knew it.</p>\n<p>During isolation, my family have fought, eaten all the food, re- arranged our rooms and gone cRaZy!! It was hard at first but it got easier as we went along.</p>\n<p>I remember the day I found out we were homeschooling. The first thing I remember thinking was &#8216;how am I going to see my friend?&#8217;</p>\n<p>After a few days of online learning, I started to enjoy it a lot. I liked it because I could work at my own pace, go to the kitchen during lunch and recess and eat whatever I wanted and go to the toilet without needing to ask my teacher. Now we are all back at school.</p>\n<p>Did I mention before that my year 7 camp got cancelled?! Yeah, I was devastated!!!!! Hopefully it gets postponed. Anyways, that was my life during isolation.</p>\n<p>Bye! :)</p>\n <p>I walked into the shops a few weeks ago. I was getting my groceries with my mum and dad and I noticed that there was not a lot of items on the shelves, so as we were walking to the middle aisle there was a shelf that was just empty with nothing on it to one end to the other and it turns out it was the toilet paper aisle. I thought what toilet paper why toilet paper, then the hand sanitiser was all gone the tissues the paper towels. I thought we would have to use something else when we finish going to the toilet.</p>\n<p>I woke up one day, I was getting ready for school and my dad and mum said you&#8217;re not going to school today. I said why, my mum said because the school is closed you are learning online for the next 4-5 weeks. I was happy but day by day online learning got worse ,trying to find work, handing in work on time it was hard because I had never used a computer for online learning like this work.</p>\n <p>My time away from school was pretty challenging as we started to do online school work.</p>\n<p>Being away from friends and being isolated from school was very tough. Work was a bit harder as I didn&#8217;t have teachers by my side to help me and it was hard to understand some messages online. It was hard to keep up to date because of all the new emails and new tasks posted on google classroom.</p>\n<p>I did like staying home because after I was done work and homework I could relax at home. Also I kept going to the pantry and the fridge to get food during class time.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t mind staying home and doing work but I&#8217;d rather go to school to see all my friends and teachers. The thing that upset me the most is we couldn&#8217;t go on our camping trip due to Coronavirus.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad to be back at school because I get to see all my friends and teachers. My friends and I kept in touch as we would call each other or play games together on the Ps4.</p>\n<p>Life in quarantine was hard but I learned how to cope with it and I still learnt at home. It wasn&#8217;t that bad but I definitely rather be in school. I hope coronavirus never happens again so that we can stay in school, talk to our friends and be able to socialise again.</p>\n <p>COVID 19 has been hard I couldn&#8217;t see any of my friends. and facetiming them isn&#8217;t the same and I couldn&#8217;t do any sport, all sports got cancelled and I miss all my friends from soccer and school.</p>\n<p>I go to the park everyday with my family and we go shoot some hoops or we kick the ball around. The only thing that really kept me company everyday was my brothers, NETFLIX and facetiming my friends.</p>\n<p>Being back at school has been the BEST. I get to see my friends and it is so much better than being stuck at home. Our first high school camp got cancelled which was a bit disappointing but if I had to say something good came out of COVID 19 it is our NAPLAN got cancelled and saved everyone from a bunch of stressing.</p>\n <p>The things we&#8217;ve seen in these times. Face masks as fashion statements, no toilet paper to be seen, the stock has gone in one day, what a world it is.</p>\n<p>Recently the coronavirus has knocked us out of the idea we manifested 2020 to be, last year we thought that we would have the Olympics, elections, and a calm year. People are financially and mentally scared form Covid-19, from losing jobs and losing lives and just scary.</p>\n<p>But the coronavirus has given some good outcomes, for example, because we can&#8217;t go anywhere we had a lot of family time. From movie nights to game nights and 1000 piece puzzles, it hasn&#8217;t been too bad.</p>\n <p>Isolating at home through COVID-19 was kinda fun, I got to do a work out everyday and video call my friends. But it&#8217;s had some down sides it stopped me from going to Queensland and camp. I found at home I was doing more work at home than a school but the best thing was that NAPLAN got cancelled.</p>\n <p>ANONYMOUS<br />\nNSW</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has had a impact on the world. You can no longer sit at restaurants and you must stay at least 1.5 meters away from people at all times. It is now normal to see people walking around with masks and gloves.</p>\n <p>Covid-19 has been a deadly virus that has spread through almost all countries around the world. Because of how contagious the virus is, people have been isolating in their homes and have been in quarantine. Because of this I need to always have an activity to keep me occupied. Before Covid-19 started, I bought 2 budgies which I now play with every time I become bored in my house. Another have started doing is turning my backyard into a camp ground. We&#8217;d go for walks in the morning and after dinner.</p>\n<p>When things settled down, we were allowed to visit relatives so my dad&#8217;s sister and her family came to our house. We watched TV, played with our budgies, played in the backyard then had dinner. once we finished eating they went home. The next day we went to the park to play soccer, we set up the goals, and played a mini game of soccer.</p>\n <p>When I first heard about Covid-19, it didn&#8217;t sound like it was going to affect me much, but as it started to spread and come to Australia I realized that it was serious. When lock down came I was stuck inside, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to go outside, or even go get groceries. when it came to doing school virtually, it proved to be more of a challenge than I expected, I wasn&#8217;t very good with organizing everything but I came to get used to it. </p>\n<p>Covid-19 lock down was hard because you quickly run out of things to do because you can&#8217;t go anywhere and for some reason people are buying all the toilet paper and they are stocking up on everything, so when you would go to the shops there wouldn&#8217;t be many essentials left, but it has gotten better with added restrictions so they could reduce the spread of the virus. During lock down it was hard but worth it to reduce the spread of Covid-19.</p>\n <p>I have struggle working from home but I did enjoy having recess and lunch had home because i could go anywhere in my house and pick what food I had for recess and lunch.</p>\n<p>During this time I have been learning how to stand up on a bike and I have been gaming more often which I like. i also been having more time to talk to my parents which was good.</p>\n <p>This has been a very surprising several weeks.</p>\n<p>Our country has done so well to try and prevent this coincidence<br />\nand all I have been doing is trying to not get sick but still being active at the same time which is what I have done. I have got up at 5:30 every morning except on Saturday&#8217;s and went to the park in the 2 degree cool weather and practice my soccer so than when it comes back to the season to be not slacking and coming out to the new season ready to go.</p>\n <p>Isolation was extremely challenging for me. I know everyone else is struggling because this is a new thing for all of us, but I feel like this isolation has hit me harder than others.</p>\n<p>Everyday was just really stressful for me and I felt like I was slowly breaking down. I thought there weren&#8217;t any options when I was behind on work and I was never going to catch up. I actually thought that maybe if I dropped out or worse that I would be free from all this stress, but it just put more pressure on me. Is my future ruined? Am I going to be able to get into a university?</p>\n<p>I was always arguing with myself whether I would become a total failure or if there was another opportunity for me to redeem myself. The first day of school back, I started crying because of all the pressure and stress I was under. I&#8217;m so glad I don&#8217;t have to feel that pressure anymore.</p>\n<p>The teachers were very understanding and I had the courage to go to class. I&#8217;m so happy that the teachers understand how stressful this isolation is for others like me and I&#8217;m glad they were able to calm me down just before I went to class otherwise I would have been a mess.</p>\n <p>The way we live in this modern age day has changed, the view of people has changed.</p>\n<p>As we are currently in the middle of a pandemic we all see the world differently, some people may think it is nothing and brush it off their shoulders others may stress about it. We should all remember that everyone is in the same position as us and we should not worry. It is hard to not worry and take your mind off something if your parents are constantly speaking about it.</p>\n<p>You can always remember that there are positives to this world wide pandemic, one of them could be that you get to spend more time with your family and you really realize how much you value your friendships.</p>\n<p>I have a best friend and we really miss each other due to this pandemic but, all that comes to my mind is that I am really fortunate to have a best friend who is always by my side and who is always there for me no matter how far apart we are we will always be best friends.</p>\n<p>The world has changed for the good, think about the environment that has had a restart during these tough times. Air pollution levels have dropped.</p>\n<p>Online learning has started and social distancing is in place. Just remember that you should always value your friendships even in you are social distanced from each other or unable to see each other, even if the only way you can communicate is via technology. You are still friends and even though I am in lockdown I would never change my best friend for the world.</p>\n <p>COVID-19 IS DRIVING ME MENTAL!</p>\n<p>It ruined my holidays and stopped me from seeing auntie&#8217;s new puppy.</p>\n<p>My life would be so much better if I could I could actually USE TOILET PAPER. It also stopped me from taking a trip to Italy and I&#8217;m Italian and never been :( !</p>\n<p>On the plus side NAPLAN was cancelled but so was school camp :(.</p>\n <p>Learning from home and experiencing living in isolation for a few weeks was quite a challenge and made me appreciate where I live and go to school a lot more.</p>\n<p>When we were self isolating we couldn&#8217;t see any of our friends or family that didn&#8217;t live in our household. This was challenging because not seeing anyone, except my family that I live with made me feel a bit lonely.</p>\n<p>But the remote learning and self isolation wasn&#8217;t all bad. I learnt a lot more skills that will help me to overcome problems in life and I also spent a lot more time with my family and pets which I&#8217;m sure they loved.</p>\n<p>Overall, this experience in the world was something that will never be forgotten. It will be passed down in history and people will always remember how lots of people put so much effort into helping people who had experienced Covid 19.</p>\n <p>I can sleep at night, don&#8217;t know about you but. I never thought I would be in such a bumpy time, the world is confused, very confused. </p>\n<p>It is a new way and if you&#8217;re reading this in the future(what happened?). no one in my family has &#8220;it&#8221; but I have heard stories of cruise ships and flights gone wrong, mum and dad say we are lucky they didn&#8217;t lose their jobs, but I don&#8217;t know. I just returned to school we had like 2 MONTHS off and yes, it was the best.</p>\n<p>The news plays things up (ha I did a speech on that in primary).</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s next, well, welcome to the unknown! everyone even the experts don&#8217;t know any more. people say I am lucky as I got to have four days on highschool each week.</p>\n<p>I am begging so meta (help me isolation is killing me! metaphorically)</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t wait till we get to zero cases, then I can be free yay!</p>\n<p>look on the bright side we got new words!? eg iso, &#8216;rona and self-isolation.</p>\n<p>so&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well whatever next I will be optimistic nothing I can face, right?</p>\n <p>Covid nineteen is different from any other sickness, it cannot be ignored like the common cold or mended like a broken bone because at the time I am writing this there is still no vaccine for this pandemic. People are posting cures online for the coronavirus to try and scam people.</p>\n<p>It was a hard experience working from home and I know that many children wanted to work from home but they don&#8217;t know how hard it is to do the work and not get distracted by the Xbox and other things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <p>The COVID 19 pandemic in my opinion has changed the way Australians live their life everyday.  For me, being stuck at home wasn&#8217;t really a problem at first, but as the weeks went on, I felt myself getting restless and annoyed.  There is only so much you can do at home.  </p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe when a normally busy street had turned into an almost deserted ghost town.  I spent a lot of time with my dog which I wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to because of school and other things.  </p>\n<p>The first time I went to the mall, almost everyone  was wearing a face mask and rushing to the shops to stock up on items such as food and toilet paper. Videos showing people fighting each other just for a simple eight rolls of toilet paper.  It really captured how this virus was bringing everyone to their worst.  </p>\n<p>I am delighted that this pandemic is almost about to end and everything is going back to normal.  Schools are open, more people are on the streets and the safety measures are becoming less restricted.</p>\n <p>2020, also known as the year of disasters, especially for Australia.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s something no one has probably ever expected. Schools shut, Cafes shut, it has felt as if we&#8217;re like animals, being stuck at home, day in day out.</p>\n<p>The most exciting thing that would happen is when you would see someone you know when you go for a walk, don&#8217;t get me started on walks, everyone would go for a walk to get out of the house. I remember when I went to drop something over to my grandparents, my nan didn&#8217;t stop about all the dogs she has seen over the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>Facetime was really the only way I could see my friends unless we went for a walk to the park but we would have to stay 1.5m away from each other. My screen time hasn&#8217;t been so high ever before. I had a little routine going on when I didn&#8217;t have online school, TikTok then Netflix next to Instagram, now to facetiming friends for a while and then the cycle would just keep going.</p>\n<p>For me, the online school was good, besides the fact that I didn&#8217;t have my friends. I was able to do my work quickly and efficiently too. I wouldn&#8217;t get distracted or any of that, it helps that I am very self-motivated.</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re reading this, has anything changed? For us, this is the new normal for a while, some days I forget what it was like before all of this.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this, just remember to live every day to the best.</p>\n <p>Loss, dead and infected.</p>\n<p>In recent months a virus named the Covid 19 has took the world by storm. The words above have been filling the world of media, every day one soul is taken by the virus. It&#8217;s been months since I seen people and socialized, even though I had the chance to socialize we were limited. We&#8217;re not permitted to be closer than 1.5 meters, heck even accidentally spitting on someone will fine you 5000 dollars.</p>\n<p>To composite for the lack of socializing, many schools opted to do online school. Online school would include group chats group calls and even video calls. This boosted many kids moral and mental state. But it was still not authentic. In this time the whole world had time evaluate the positives in life and to be grateful for what they had.</p>\n<p>Overall, even this virus took many lives, this virus taught us to be grateful for what we have. As one day something like a virus might take us all away.</p>\n <p>Unpopular opinion = coronavirus is exactly what we needed.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying we need all these people to die, but you have to realise how this has affected the Earth and the world. The oceans in Venice, Italy are clear and full of fish for the first time in many years. The air in China is clear because there is no pollution from the cars. China&#8217;s road accidents have gone down by a lot. I believe this is Mother Nature taking the Earth back into her hands.</p>\n <p>Looking forward to a new and better year ended up being the year we all lost our toilet paper and hand sanitizer. Covid-19 has inturrupted too many of everyone&#8217;s activities and forced us to stay at home, locked up in our houses doing absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>Which is something I&#8217;m terrible at, I always need to be out and about either playing touch, at dance, kicking a ball, going for runs with my friend and ESPECIALLY going jet ski-ing.</p>\n<p>When I heard that school was off I was soooo excited, but then 2 weeks into homeschooling I wished I was back. For some strange reason I actually was super excited to get back to school.</p>\n<p>School wasn&#8217;t the thing that bothered me the most, but being told only one person on a jetski at a time is when I got mad. Especially because I knew my dad would take this opportunity to his advantage.</p>\n<p>So for the past 8 weeks I haven&#8217;t gone jetski-ing!!!</p>\n <p>Where do I even start Covid- 19 has impacted everyone&#8217;s lives and it has spread all over the world killing many, many people. Shops shut down, people have lost their jobs and people are locked in their houses all day.</p>\n<p>During isolation I have done many different things to keep myself entertained such as bike riding, arts and craft, facetiming my friends and baking. It was hard not seeing my friends everyday and doing online school was something new to me. It was great not having to wake up early to get ready for school and I was able finish my work early so I had time for other things. At the same time it was difficult to learn from home because I had to learn at such a fast pace.</p>\n<p>The best thing about isolation was I got to spend quality time with my family and got to do many things with them. I have never spent so much time with my family until now. It was hard to not see my cousins and grandparents every Sunday but luckily we had Zoom.</p>\n<p>Before isolation happened people were going crazy over toilet rolls and hand sanitizer, like who would of thought people would go crazy over that.</p>\n<p>Overall Covid- 19 has impacted everyone&#8217;s lives and has made people go crazy, this has been a new and scary experience for everyone and it will surely go down in history.</p>\n<p>2020, has been the most hectic year of all.</p>\n <p>I am a 12 year old student in year 7. Today is my second day back at school. The coronavirus has kept everyone at home in self isolation working from home and finally I am able to get out of the house and see my friends. Before I started doing homeschooling, I thought I would enjoy not going to school. I actually really missed it and was very excited to be back.</p>\n<p>One thing I am finding hard coming back to school is having to social distance. I am used to sitting at one table with all my friends and now we have to be all spread out across two rooms.</p>\n<p>The world nowadays is crazy. You can&#8217;t cough in public otherwise people will think you have the virus, you can&#8217;t celebrate your birthday with all your friends, your holidays get cancelled and you have to stay 1.5 metres away from other people. Even though these rules are annoying, I know we need them to stop the virus spreading.</p>\n<p>By Sophia</p>\n <p>Part two.</p>\n<p>The next couple of weeks after that big day resulted in sudden crying episodes out of the blue, to looking inwards and noticing the people I lived with. I got used to the new normal – the quality time taken to make Ravensburger and Totoro puzzles, baking creatively, caring about the food we ate, dancing like an idiot with the whole family, crafting, eating dinner in candle-light.</p>\n<p>Life in the slow lane is so rewarding.  No one overtaking you, no plans, no dramas, except Facebook groups like Inner West Mums which went off on people not following social distancing rules and a Class of 2000 Zoom Alumni catchup.   I kinda got used it being slow &#8211; this hibernation where only the present mattered. Not the past or the future.  All the things my favourite books about Slow Living preached about is now so easily achieved.  I think there was a lot of growing up from a 4 year old, 38 year old (myself) and the 41 year old too.   Approaching the eminent COVID lockdown my worst fear was to be trapped in my 50 square metre, cold, dungeony shoebox apartment in the Inner West.  Now I fear going back to the usual.   Afterall, I have realised I was trapped inside with my favourite people in the world, and I have really enjoyed being with them.</p>\n <p>A small relaxation on restrictions kicked in last week — 2 adults and their dependent children can visit another household, for ‘care’ purposes, recognising human beings need contact with each other for good mental health.  And so today, my sister, her partner and their son are coming up to the Blue Mountains from St Peters.   The kids could barely sleep last night, so thrilled to have visitors it might have been Christmas.  Thankfully a few chapters from “The Extremely Inconvenient Adventures of Bronte Mettlestone’ by Jaclyn Moriarty gave expression, release and relief to their excitement, chewing up time before bed and offering delightful distraction into sleep &amp; dreams.</p>\n<p>We made a mushroom &amp; spinach frittata for their visit this morning, M made  his sourdough, and our family arrived with a selection of pastries from Sydney as a treat.  We made a pot of tea and ate the pastries before we walked down to the fire trail leading to Hazel Falls. We passed an abandoned camp.  It’s eerie—the sleeping bag and old coffee tin layered in dust, untouched for a time, under a stone ledge. My kids want to explore it but we call them back. An officer told me there were many such camps, and itinerants circulate through them, moving from one to the next on a never-ending cycle.</p>\n<p>Some of the family reached the waterfall ahead of the rest. If you stand at the bottom and look up, you have the uncanny feeling of being inside a giant ceramic bowl, such is the layering of dark stone and moss.  It is wet-walled, a rainforest growth, and it was briefly quiet—the first of the group were lucky enough to see a big, beautiful, blue yabbie in the pool, before the noise of the boys sent it scuttling for cover.</p>\n <p>(Shopping &#8211; part 2)</p>\n<p>A browse through the specials catalogue revealed a few items I wanted. TB bone steak at $20 a kilo sounded nice, but they only had T bone steak at $27 a kilo. Ice cream was half price so I bought twice as much as I needed. Also pasta sauce was half price, but alas the shelf was bare. Accepting that was about all I was going to secure today I got on the checkout queue. Yes there was a queue, even at Marulan and I was number 7. While queuing, a shelf stacker pushed a trolley past. I spotted it and left my place in the queue to follow that trolley. Another shelf stacker who had previously noticed my disappointment at the lack of pasta sauce noticed me chasing the other stacker and told him that he was being followed. Her exact words were “Tim you are being followed, but he is not a fan of yours he just wants the pasta sauce.” She was right, Tim was not my type, I only wanted him for his pasta sauce.</p>\n<p>As I approached, Tim brandishing his Stanley knife, deftly cut open the pack and like a starving refugee I grabbed two bottles, said thank you and gave Tim a big smile. That probably made his day.</p>\n<p>Checked out, back to the car, applied a dollop of hand sanitiser from my almost empty bottle and headed home.</p>\n <p>Living through the stressful time of the COVID &#8211; 19 pandemic, has changed my perspective of a lot of things, especially as it is my first year of high school. The bushfires at the start of the year destroying hundreds of homes, then the floods in Queensland and then coronavirus. This year has been the year of disasters. </p>\n<p>Everyone blaming china for starting the virus, at the wet markets in Wuhan. Working from home, the stress of not knowing how to do your work and watching the news every night with updates of what&#8217;s going on around the world. Texting your friends online isn&#8217;t the same anymore because you have nothing to say as you haven&#8217;t done anything. The fact of knowing we are restricted to not go outside scares people. Not knowing how loved ones are doing, not seeing your friends and not knowing if you will get your job back.</p>\n <p>I HAVE BEEN STUCK AT HOME FOR AROUND FIVE WEEKS I JUST STARTED GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TODAY IS MY SECOND DAY. I have had to work online for a while it has been a very confusing time during this covid-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>During this time here in Australia we have been fighting over toilet paper and hand sanitizer (which is basically gold at the moment). It has caused Australia to go crazy over small things like sanitary items. The internet is going crazy now that everyone is stuck at home.</p>\n<p>Birthdays and special days like ANZAC day and Mother&#8217;s day are not the same at the moment, parties cannot go on. We have not found a cure for the virus but we are getting closer each day. The only social interaction we get is going to school or talking to your family at home. I almost forgot to say that I have to walk my dogs like everyday.</p>\n<p>bye</p>\n <p>It was a normal Friday afternoon when I was sitting in the classroom doing my Religion lesson. Then one of our teachers came into the classroom. He was telling us that the government had been telling all parents to keep their children at home for the safety of their families. You are probably wondering why we had to stay home. There was this massive killing virus going around. It was called &#8220;Corona Virus&#8221; also known as COVID 19. Soon after we were told to stay home, the government made up the decision to close down all cafes, pubs, clubs, hairdressers, and more. The only places that were open were shopping centers, chemists, and hospitals. </p>\n<p>All people were isolated from everyone for several weeks. I was in Year 7. All the children had to go online and do there classwork on the computer. This time was very stressful. I found it so much easier to have a teacher standing in front of me explaining all the tasks to me. 8 weeks later we were allowed to go back to school. Only a few schools opened up, and I was lucky enough to have mine open back up. There are still many cases of COVID 19 going around. But our teachers are always telling us that school is the safest place to be as it was only built recently and we only have our grade here, year 7. But if there were more classes there would be higher chances of someone catching it. Now thinking about it I am so grateful that I am in a safe environment. I know I will be safe here. I can&#8217;t wait until this horrible disaster settles down so I can get back to living a normal life with not so much chaos around me. 2020 </p>\n <p>I am an elderly citizen of this state with a minor heart condition, so I have been following the request of the government to stay isolated at home.  I only go out for a walk each weekday which takes me a little over 30 minutes but it is all hills and dales.</p>\n<p>This ISO was progressively making me feel quite depressed and wondering what I should do.  Then last night my daughter, my son-in-law and my two grandchildren arrived for dinner to celebrate Mother&#8217;s Day.  Wow!  It was so wonderful.  After short time I felt a new person.  The laughter, family discussion, the smiles on the children&#8217;s faces, the excitement of exchanging news and mostly the love I could feel in the whole house.</p>\n<p>My house once again felt like a happy home and I feel I can go through more isolation for a little longer.</p>\n <p>Don’t kiss the kids, don’t smooch the spouse,<br />\nWipe all the doorknobs, disinfect the house.<br />\nHold your social distance and monitor your space,<br />\nDon’t stand too close or you’ll cop a virus in the face!</p>\n<p>Avoid shaking hands when you arrive at the meeting,<br />\nDo tapping elbows cos it’s the new proper greeting.<br />\nAnd when you’re out shopping, here’s some free advice:<br />\n‘Go gently down the aisles, don’t hoard, be nice!’</p>\n<p>‘Cos there are some people struggling,<br />\nWorrying how they’ll cope.<br />\nSo be a decent Aussie,<br />\nAnd offer them some hope.</p>\n<p>March 25 [singalong with kids]</p>\n<p>If you’re happy and you know it, wash your hands!

Also a negative comment from my self is that most of us can only go to school for one day not one week and I am disappointed by this because I miss my friends and teachers, even though we have FaceTime and Zoom meetings it is still not the same as us seeing each other in person. </p>\n<p>This virus has made people feel unsafe because toilet paper and hand sanitizer has been a big concern to all, but we are slowly becoming better and controlling our selfs to work together to slow this virus down as much as possible. One thing that has been slowing it down is the people that have been isolating at home with family. And when this COVID-19 thing has passed things will be different for everyone, and people have been adapting so well to the new rules that the restrictions that were at level 3 in Australia it did mean that schools were only for children for who’s parents were at work and some parents or adults did loose there jobs during this time and it has been hard, but the restrictions in Australia have been lowered because people have been Listening and they have been staying home. </p>\n<p>So even though everyone has been through a lot during this hard and difficult period of time I am sure we can get through it together and we can help each other as well. So reader, just remember us Australians have gone through so much so everyone even YOU reader just remember also how lucky you are.</p>\n <p>Hi,<br />\nMy name is Ciara and i&#8217;m twelve years old. Isolation has been very boring for me and my family, but also fun. I get to do box breaks with my dad, read lots of books and sleep.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been very hard to deal with isolation because I can&#8217;t see any friends and see family, online learning has been hard because the teachers aren&#8217;t there to help you at all, and the work is just handed to you and has to be handed in by a certain day.</p>\n<p>I have been doing Physical exercise with my Dad and sister for 6 weeks, I also do Zoom meetings for my Ice Hockey so we can keep our skills up so when we come back we are ahead with learning. </p>\n<p>I had to stay at home for 8 weeks and not go anywhere because my parents are afraid that we&#8217;re going to catch it</p>\n<p>But I have to keep my family and friends healthy</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t wait until all this COVID-19 stuff is over and see friends and family again</p>\n <p>Hey I&#8217;m Ava,</p>\n<p>Isolation has been a strange time for all of us with online work and schooling and social distancing. As a student its hard focusing on my work while at home and having to email and wait for a reply from teachers instead of getting a straight answer in a usual class at school. Staying at home all the time has been a little boring, I like to get up and go out to go to school and see my friends and family.</p>\n<p>At first online schooling was a bit nerve racking but I got used to it. I didn&#8217;t get to see my friends or family much but we did stay in contact through technology which was ok. However some good things did come out of isolation such as spending more time with my cat, being more creative with art, riding my bike more often and of course watching Netflix. </p>\n<p>I just started high school and even at the end of term 1 I had to stay at home which was a little stressful especially with submitting work online. Isolation has been a slow experience so far and I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to things slowly going back to normal.</p>\n <p>Binge watching, gaming and doing anything you possibly can on the internet to stay connected. But haven&#8217;t you realised we are just doing the same thing we do every weekend playing the same games and  watching new things on netflix. Why not try something different like building puzzles or drawing. There are so many other things we can do in this time in lockdown. You can play with your family and build cubby houses with your brothers and sisters. Working at home is a struggle and people are dying from this pandemic but I think that this pandemic could be not that bad. Nature is coming out finally in a long time. Can&#8217;t anyone see how the animals are happier and the earth looks like it hasn&#8217;t felt this good in ages. This pandemic has ups and downs but it&#8217;s different.</p>\n <p>Liverpool haven&#8217;t won the league in 30 years. 25 points clear of the title, it is statistically impossible for anyone to catch up. it would be the most Liverpool thing if there would be a pandemic that cancels the league and they don&#8217;t win the title.</p>\n <p>To my reader,</p>\n<p>This is a pandemic.</p>\n<p>Not the fictitious kind found in a dystopian novel, but the kind that will feature in biographies and history books.</p>\n<p>It has been a time of extreme paradox: we have, collectively, felt alone; we have been imprisoned in our own homes (the places we have previously yearned to be); we have been well rested and restless; idle and anxious. It is a strange thing to wake up, get dressed and sit at a home office. A peculiar routine.</p>\n<p>The first wave brought fear. We were rushing to shops and clutching for non-perishables and toilet paper and hand sanitiser. Glen 20 was out of stock for far too long. I ran out of hand soap, so we used body wash for a while. We stocked our freezers and planted seedlings. After a few weeks the chaos settled like the autumn leaves on the pavement and we finally exhaled, long and slow.</p>\n<p>The next wave brought us back to our roots.</p>\n<p>We are baking bread from scratch, doing crafts, watering our gardens and making our own coffee. We have been writing poems and binging television programs, learning a language and calligraphy and all about ourselves. We have been lighting candles and drinking wine and cleaning our houses. Calling our friends and family on FaceTime and writing them letters. We are reading books (so many books). We are praying.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it will be over soon, but, at the very least, the pandemic has shown us the whole range of ourselves (both individually and collectively). We will globally bond from this shared experience and we will come out of it knowing a hell-of-a-lot more about who we are and what we want from this life.</p>\n<p>The pandemic is terrible.</p>\n<p>But we are doing so so good.</p>\n<p>CPG.</p>\n <p>I’m planning my Zoom talk for the Society of Womens&#8217; Writers tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been asked to talk about how I became a wildlife photographer and publisher of children&#8217;s books.</p>\n<p>How can I condense 25 years following animals in the wild into 45 minutes? So many wonderful adventures to talk about. The magic moment of my life with two cheetahs, the scarriest evening when a lion chased a wildebeest through the middle of the mess tent I was in, a close encounter with a mountain gorilla and a misunderstanding with a male orangutan.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll show some large photographs to break up talking, a video, and of course my latest book. Must remember to tag the important pages.</p>\n<p>Now to clean up my studio so the audience doesn&#8217;t see my mess and test everything for tomorrow.</p>\n<p>www.truetolifebooks.com.au</p>\n <p>Of course, Covid 19 has been challenging for everybody. Although there are many negatives in this situation, many positives have come out of it as well. One of my favourite parts of this quarantine was being able to see how resilient the entire world was in this crazy situation.</p>\n<p>We have all found so many ways to keep ourselves entertained whilst being stuck inside our home and that was so exciting to see for example the teddy bear hunts in my suburb were so much fun.</p>\n<p>Overall I feel like this has been a crazy but very interesting time for all people, I have learnt a lot, spent quality time with my family, got lots of exercise and just had a lot of fun.</p>\n <p>My experience in Covid-19 was fun and annoying at the same time. I had to do homeschooling which was fun. I liked it at home because i could relax and I finally didn&#8217;t have anything to do because i am always on weekend holidays.</p>\n<p>I am the middle brother of three boys so i always had someone to talk to. I was on top of my work and i never handed anything in late. I was going on bike rides nearly every weekend with my friends and my family. I personally loved it because I was starting to want a break from friends and just spend a week without seeing someone but I got more than i asked for.</p>\n<p>I have had the marvel movie series since Christmas and i really wanted to watch them in order with my Dad and we&#8217;ve nearly finished so thats great. When it started i didn&#8217;t understand what was happening but after listening to Gladys Berejiklian every morning it made think differently about whats happening and how lucky i am not to have the coronavirus. My Pops were high risk and we have to be super careful around them.</p>\n<p>Overall it was fun, crazy and annoying.</p>\n <p>When this pandemic started restrictions were put in. One of the restrictions was being 1.5 metres away from everyone. It got to the point where school was cancelled. Learning at home was not that bad. I personally did not like learning at home, but it was more flexible being able to do each of our subjects at different times of the day. Whenever I would turn on the TV The News would be filled with problems with jobs and people on the doll, There was also news about protests in other countries and cruise ships being infected. The most affected countries were Italy, China and USA. people were worried about immigrant or tourists coming into their country.</p>\n<p>On the 11th of May I returned back to school Thursdays being the only day at home. There were some slight differences in the way we learn like having to split up tables and not being able to do sports. We still got to do some sports like running but we couldn&#8217;t go to the park.</p>\n <p>I don&#8217;t mind isolation too much. While I hate being inside locked away from the rest of my family it has become like the new normal to me and I think I am getting use to it. I like that it gives me a bit of a break from school (I do still have to do it at home) and me and my friends have still being talking through games and facetime. I haven&#8217;t been doing much exercise but I don&#8217;t normally so that is fine with me.</p>\n<p>The only thing I can&#8217;t stand is having to stay away from all my family during this corona virus. Usually I would go visit some of my family weekly or even daily to play games and just talk and catch up. Now I can&#8217;t even see them, of course there is facetime but my grandparents not in a million years would be able to properly use that.</p>\n<p>Overall I think isolation is good for a little bit to get a break from all the outside work and what you usually do but without your family it starts to get boring. Being locked with your brother and sister is something I am hoping will end soon and as the restrictions ease off I hope to go back to what I usually do soon.</p>\n <p>Everything was most curious. Although it was a very harsh time, I believe that when we finally came together again, we were closer than ever. It was rare that people would hoard vast amounts of produce, but today it was mainstream. Everyone loves makeup or gaming PCs, everyone today collected toilet paper. Why toilet paper? I have converted from a scruncher to a folder during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Distance learning was tough. My mum, a teacher with little knowledge about technology, struggled greatly with home teaching. I would often help my weeping mother with how to shared a google doc, or how to move it from one folder to another. I would help you late into the night, the hours ticked by slowly.</p>\n<p>I woke on the 11/5 and on the news it said that children would go back to school 1 day a week. I had to go back to 4 days a week, the same time as Year 12 students. It was because of the catholic schools system.</p>\n<p>Crazy time with all this Covid-19, people wouschool ld treat it like a meme, but it is still hanging around. It is only a matter of time before the next pandemic hits. First the Spanish Flu, now Corona virus, they are coming back big and more evolved. The only thing that could be done is prepare, and prepare is all that we can do.</p>\n<p>Have a Great Day&#8230;👍</p>\n <p>Because of the corona, my school has changed in a way that I&#8217;m not used to, we must sanitize our hands after every subject and we our only allowed two people at one desk, it&#8217;s strange to be this far away from each other but it&#8217;s the best way on how to be safe&#8230;.</p>\n<p>But with lockdown, you can go CRAZY! Being locked up for that long and being locked up in a different country would make you feel like your not at a a place that you are familiar with, but as i was saying before, it&#8217;s the best way on keepig safe</p>\n <p>Caitlin Carter<br />\n12<br />\nNSW Sydney, Australia</p>\n<p>Covid-19 has been a hard time. I&#8217;m used to seeing all of my friends everyday and going out with my family. It has been a dramatic change in 2020. This was the first year i was going into high school so i was looking forward to going out with my friends but Covid-19 has made that impossible. It was also quite lonely. Not seeing my friends everyday made me feel very lonely because all i wanted to do was give my friends a hug.</p>\n<p>One good thing has come out of iso. I got closer to some people and made an amazing friend. I joined random kahoot games and had a very good time facetiming friends. Overall, iso has been an emotional rollercoaster to say the least. I&#8217;m just glad to be back at school where I can see all of my amazing friends.</p>\n<p>One other hard thing was getting necessities from the shops. Things like toilet paper and hand sanitizer became valuable items as they helped everyone keep good hygiene. I missed everyone so much in iso and I&#8217;ve learnt to appreciate the small things more.</p>\n <p>Learning online was a bit of a challenge. You felt pressured every day since school work came at you at felt work it consumed you but when we finally came to school again you were reassured by the amazing teachers that support you, give you great advice to improve your learning and to help you become a better person and do better things in life that even if it is something small.</p>\n<p>But Learning online has some pro&#8217;s too it makes you learn new skills like- when I felt pressured it helped me too manage my time better and to not procrastinate! These are skills that you notice if you go to school. I also improved my technology skills since I used my laptop a lot for some of my subjects.</p>\n<p>Things I did while I was learning online was face timing friends/ family which really helped me socially since it was really hard not seeing them every day, I spent quality time with family since they are always at work or I am at my after school activities, played with my pets, caught up on work and I watched Netflix because who doesn&#8217;t like Netflix these days?</p>\n <p>Everyday during quarantine I did my school work and finished at eleven o clock. After my work was done I went to the park every day to improve my soccer skills and quickness.</p>\n<p>Some days I went over to my cousins house to play basketball, soccer and swim in their pool. I enjoy learning at home because I have more freetime and finish my work early.</p>\n <p>The earth takes a breath and as the virus spreads<br />\nthere&#8217;s nothing but death<br />\nI hear the cries of anger<br />\nand I hear the yells of pain<br />\nthis pandemic has no gain<br />\nbut the  trees face the sun<br />\nand the animals still hear the gun<br />\nwhat if hiding is better<br />\nfor everyone</p>\n <p>Although I have seen all of the negative aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic (the job losses, increase in domestic violence and of course the deaths of so many) it does seem to me that this could be a time for the world (and the Earth) to reset. </p>\n<p>The first positive news which I heard in relation to coronavirus was how clear the Venice canals had become after Italy’s lockdown where numerous boats were no longer polluting the waterway. I was amazed at how quickly the environment had returned to a former state with organisms arriving in vast numbers (including a giant influx of jellyfish). </p>\n<p>And it wasn’t just Venice which was receiving unexpected animal visitors. My Instagram was soon flooded with images of goats, monkeys, deer, foxes, buffalo and wild boar roaming streets all around the world from Wales to New Delhi. It seemed that nature was taking back the cities.</p>\n<p>Then images of air pollution reduction started to emerge. The Himalayas were seen from India for the first time in decades and satellite imagery showed the vast reduction in pollution around Europe and China. </p>\n<p>Finally, the Earth was given a brief moment to breath and I saw what our lives could look like if we seriously tackled pollution and climate change &#8211; a brief glimmer of hope for what could be our shared future. </p>\n <p>Week 9 of WFH .</p>\n<p>9 things i&#8217;ve learnt so far </p>\n<p>1: What started as an routine of get out of bed , exercise , get changed for working and head to my living room&#8230; has now turned into box set binging and a continuous uber eats . #fun times. </p>\n<p>2: My &#8220;how to cross stitch&#8221; sits where I left it, as does our 3 week home made pottery gathering dust on the kitchen shelves .

She was a loving mother, a caring grandmother and a very  proud great grandmother. Mum did not die from coronavirus but her death was related to it. Her name was Hazel. She was ninety one.</p>\n<p>Leading up to lockdown we were able to see her for fifteen minutes daily. Mum was not mobile but her mind was very active. She worried not about herself but about her family on the &#8220;outside&#8221;. Were they keeping safe? Did they still have their jobs? Was there food on the table? Did they feel too isolated?   </p>\n<p>Trying to stay calm for her became so important but she saw through our bravado as she tried not to watch the news. The staff were kind and caring but the quick visits,  the &#8220;distance keeping&#8221; and not being able to feel a cuddle began to take there toll. </p>\n<p>Then lockdown happened.</p>\n<p>Despite daily  phone calls Mum&#8217;s blood pressure began to sky rocket and she suffered a massive stroke. A statistic not counted but one that is keenly felt.</p>\n <p>Today was my first day back in school after 6 weeks of isolation. It felt sort of weird seeing everyone again after 42 days of only seeing my family and people walking down the street but it was good to finally see them and be able to go to school and learn face to face instead of doing online learning.</p>\n <p>I have finally came back to my dear school to see my friends and teachers. </p>\n<p>My life has changed so much because of the global crisis but it has changed in a good way because I have gotten a lot better with my independent learning and I have learn&#8217;t that things can change very quickly and without any notice. </p>\n<p>During the global crisis I have started to ride my scooter or walk my dog around a few blocks and I hope that this routine will continue. </p>\n<p>It was also my birthday yesturday but even though we couldn&#8217;t meet friends at the park or at the movies I still got to talk to them through games and social media and I got to have some fun with my whole family on a zoom chat. </p>\n <p>I started year 7 thinking it was going to be like any year. Working at school, bonding with new people and living a normal life. Until everything changed&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>At the start of Term two I still went to school. I missed all my friends and couldn&#8217;t wait to see them again. Thank god for technology otherwise everything would be so difficult. When I was at school we did online learning. I made new friends and met new teachers. </p>\n<p>Although this was a difficult time  I still enjoyed it.</p>\n <p>During this pandemic I baked a lot and learnt new recipes. I also did things I would have never done like build a fort and slept in it. Today was my first day back of year 7 in 6 weeks I had only started year 7 this year yet I never thought I would be remote learning at week 10. I also didn&#8217;t realise how much we have until we lost the ability to do it and how much family time I had was amazing I absolutely loved it.</p>\n <p>I am a year 7 student at Marist Catholic College Penshurst. Today was the day that I finally went back to school after being at home for 7 weeks.</p>\n<p>The holidays weren&#8217;t so fun. Staying in doors and doing nothing but watching TV. It wasn&#8217;t like any other holidays. These few holidays have been wild and a bit of a struggle. </p>\n<p>I miss all the sport teams that I&#8217;ve been in and hope that this pandemic won&#8217;t be much longer.  </p>\n<p>Now onto the fun and not serious things. I got to spend more time with my family, especially my brother. I cooked and baked some things which was fun because I don&#8217;t usually. Riding my bike everyday with my brother is the best, even though we don&#8217;t get along.</p>\n<p>So far today has been so fun seeing my friends at school.  </p>\n <p>My family and I have been in isolation for 9 weeks, and I finally got to go back to school today. It was really nice to see everyone again but honestly I was kind of scared. I&#8217;m a year 7 student and I have never really done assessments before and I have some due next week, because we have been online learning I feel like I have missed some of the work. I also have very strong opinions, it fills me with anger when I see our prime minister as he has handled covid-19 in the worst way possible and it is extremely confusing.</p>\n <p>Going back to school was the BEST THING EVER!</p>\n<p>Seeing all of my friends and teachers was amazing and who knew we were going to make history for past generations to look upon. </p>\n<p>I have spent time with lots of my best friends on face time finding out stuff that I never knew about them. My whole family has come together each night to watch an episode of a TV show every night. After all of this I am hoping to still watch TV with my family and find new things out about friends.</p>\n <p>Today I went to school for the first time and I felt free but also staying safe. My first year in high school has been different to what I expected.But it has also taught me to care for others more and also to spend more time with the people I love most.</p>\n <p>Today I went back to school for the first time in about 7 weeks!. This year was my first year of highschool and never in my wildest dreams would I ever had imagined this. Stuck inside, not able to see anyone and not able to go to school!. It has been extremely challenging being in isolation, away from friends, family and my teachers.</p>\n <p>The Coronavirus where do I start. Everyone around the world&#8217;s life has changed. School. Work. Family. Friends. Sport. All different.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t go to school because earlier in the year my dad got sick and if he gets the virus well, he will be fighting for his life. All I want to do is go and see my friends, family, but I know I can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Every week I would go to swimming on Mondays and netball 2 times a week now all I do is go on walks everyday, other than that I am pretty much on the screen the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Mothers day was so different I couldn&#8217;t even hug my grandmas or go near them.</p>\n<p>It is pretty hard because i only just started year 7 and just settled in and now suddenly i am working from home. I have been at home for 8 weeks now and there is not a clear passage way on when I am going to go back.  </p>\n <p>I have found the corona virus a bit of both. I&#8217;ve enjoyed quarantine because i get to stay home, watch Netflix, chill and stay in my pjs all day.</p>\n<p>But the bad thing is that i don&#8217;t get to hang out with my friends, go shopping like i cant do any fun stuff i&#8217;m just stuck at home all day everyday.</p>\n<p>But then again the corona virus has changed a-lot of things, like i&#8217;ve never really seen lots of people go on walks and now everyone is outside on walks.</p>\n <p>Our school had never been so quiet. </p>\n<p>I sat at a desk in the corner of the classroom, cold biting at my ankles. Our teacher sat at their desk armed with hand sanitizer and desk cleaner. It was so quiet that I could hear my own breathing loud and clear. Everyone was staring at their screen, work or video calls plastered across it. </p>\n<p>Only one of my friends was here today and they were put in a different class. The silence was torture. Every time I looked back at my screen, I would get distracted by a bird flying by or by one of my friends, talking online. </p>\n<p>Occasionally there would be someone talking. It was a relief to hear someone, through all the silence. But, they would be sent out if they wanted to talk on a video call. </p>\n<p>I wished I stayed home, at least then I could talk to people. My work laid forgotten on the desk, my friends came first. I caved in. I spent the next hour talking to them, being in my own bubble of happiness. </p>\n <p>I thank God I live in this wonderful country of ours.  It may not seem it to a lot of those not lucky enough to own their own home or have a secure roof over their heads, but our statistics tell us that to date, we have escaped the full force of this surreal pandemic of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>At first I was scared, really scared that I might not survive.  I have a heart/lung condition that means my outlook would be bleak if I contracted the virus &#8211; but &#8211; one has to eat, and visit the doctor, and chemist, so my wonderful partner and I, donned up with good masks and white cotton gloves, venture out to our nearest supermarket, as infrequently as we can.  Problem is that fruit and vegetables only last so long.</p>\n<p>The streets are so quiet &#8211; so few cars.  The noise of jetplanes flying overhead so infrequent as to be novel now.  </p>\n<p>I stopped listening to the news on radio or watching the endless TV programs &#8211; all about coronavirus &#8211; ages ago.  I get a quick update every now and then.  But it is just too sad.</p>\n<p>I had planned a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the UK for the middle of 2020, but as it became more and more obvious that this wasn&#8217;t going to happen, I &#8216;bit the bullet&#8217; and cancelled everything.  OK Qantas, when do I get some indication of a refund?</p>\n<p>I have changed from being scared for myself now, to worrying about my loved ones.  I just hope everyone is taking the good advice to wash their hands, keep your distance and wear a mask if you need to  (I do!) even though it seems a lot of experts say it&#8217;s not necessary.  Ya&#8217; reckon?</p>\n <p>As a 12 year old kid I&#8217;ve been going through this pandemic like any 12 year old kid. We get up every morning doing the same thing every day.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some pros but there&#8217;s always cons as well. I think 2 of the many pros would be learning more things about my family and sleeping in.</p>\n<p>Some of the cons are not being able to see friends and not being able to see other relatives.</p>\n <p>Covid-19</p>\n<p>Before Covid-19 my life was, get up at 6:40am, go for a run, come back home eat breakfast, get dressed for school, catch the bus to school. After school is over i catch the bus home eat some food and go outside, but now it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n<p>Get up at 7:40am go down stairs and eat breakfast, go upstairs and go online for school. Once school is over I go downstairs and eat food, then go outside and go for a walk.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up,<br />\nThis experience has made me realise that we should be so thankful for the freedom we have in this country.</p>\n <p>The Corona Virus life</p>\n<p>I woke up everyday. Had breakfast, Brushed my teeth, Got dressed and did my hair. Then i hopped onto my computer and did my online schooling.</p>\n<p>It was boring. I had no one else to interact with (except for my family) I couldn&#8217;t play with my friends or have fun.</p>\n<p>Spending time with my family was fun though.  We learnt more about each other and tried to make the best out of the corona virus life.</p>\n<p>Arriving back at school was exciting and strange. For me it was awkward seeing my friends and teaches. Luckily we could still interact and be normal.</p>\n<p>Now more people are back at school but it is still different.</p>\n <p>Living in this pandemic is rough. School is educational but unsocial without my friends here. Being at home is lonely as well because i cant go out and hang with my friends. I enjoy the extra time with my family but i think our dog is pretty much over all the tense walks around the neighbour hood after all of our arguments.</p>\n<p>All in all the pandemic is kind of like going through a test of how we bond and connect together as human beings in this unique experience.</p>\n <p>Hmmmmm the Coronavirus where do i start&#8230;</p>\n<p>First of all I am quite enjoying the spare time knowing that i used to only have Sunday as my free day :(   but now :)!!!! EVERY DAY IS FREE!!!!</p>\n<p>On the bad side i&#8217;m not allowed to see my friends or go out for dinner. I cant even go tubing on the boat with my friends or swim at the beach.</p>\n<p>Overall I cant even decide wether I&#8217;m happy or sad about it.</p>\n <p>COVID 19</p>\n<p>Before Coronavirus we went to school normally and everyone was there. There was no social distancing. Everything was normal </p>\n<p>Now, there are not many people at school and we have to social distance. We are all at home looking at computer screens. I, personally like being at home because it is more comfortable.</p>\n <p>Something challenging and that I haven’t liked about this Covid-19 situation, is that we don’t get to see our friends and family because we are self-isolating and only allowed to go out for essential items. It has been hard to also not be able to see family and also Grandparents. The reason why we were self-isolating was because of how contagious the virus was that it was best to stay at home and keep our distance to people so we wouldn’t spread or catch the virus. </p>\n<p>Something that I have liked about this experience is how we get to spend way more time with our family at home. A thing related to school that I like about this time is that we get to start at own time and work at our pass. We are still able to connect to family and friends by ZOOM and FaceTime calls. Being the class of 2020 it will 100% be a year that will never be forgotten by absolutely no one. During this time there has been lots of positive and negative things. </p>\n<p>I think that we will never get back to normal but, we will get a new normal, where more parents might be working from home, and that we will not have as many cases of the flu and colds because we will have lots of good hygiene. This time we are going through will never be forgotten and I will remember this time every single day, looking back on it and how we had to work from home and not be able to see our friends everyday at school. It will be a story I will always be able to tell to my kids or grandkids and how much the world has changed from the world that they would be in. </p>\n <p>The Coronavirus has been a time of mixed emotions for me and everyone. My life has changed a truck load. If you told me this last year I wouldn’t believe you. A lot of negatives have come out of this but I’m gonna start with the positives. Firstly, I have been spending a lot more time with my family by playing board games and just chatting, I have also have been going on walks everyday with my family. I also figured out because I have been spending a lot more time at home, I have been doing a lot of exercising, like walks, bike rides and playing soccer in the back yard. </p>\n<p>Now onto the negatives, firstly staying inside has been driving me crazy! In isolation I’ve been really noticing the importance of seeing friends and family. We also have to do school work, we are only aloud to go out when exercising, shopping or when your parent is essential worker, you might have to go to school, we also have to social distance (1.5 metres apart) when outside. Despite all the negatives this global pandemic has been a very interesting experience for all of us experiencing it. I hope it’s going to end soon.</p>\n <p>Something I haven’t liked during this period of Covid-19 is that I haven’t been able to spend time with my family and friends it was a challenge as I’m Italian and whenever we gather with people we kiss them and hug them automatically, but of course we have to follow the social distancing rules. This year’s celebrations are a little bit different as we are not aloud to gather with other people so Easter, Mother’s Day and other celebrations were very quite. But something I’ve loved during this time is that it’s getting me ready for high school, I have also been able to spend more time with my family and I have been able to go through my work faster. </p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to when the restrictions ease as I can see my friends and family. At this point in time I feel a little bit captured and I felt like the world was going to end, when thousands of people were dying due to the Corona Virus. I thought 2020 would have been a great year but it has started worse than I thought it would have. I wasn’t even able to see my grandparents but now I can only see my nonna as my other grandparents live in a nursing home so only people over 16 can see them so they are not very happy that they can’t see their grandchildren. I can’t wait till we can live a normal life this is basically the new normal for us. Our school was only open for those parents kids who were essential. I have missed being able to socialise. This experience will go down into history and we will be able to tell our kids when we are older and say this is what happened&#8230;</p>\n<p>By Isabella</p>\n <p>Hello there future generation what year is it for you 2025? 2030? 2040? Have you ever heard about The Corona virus? Well you see right now I am in the middle of The Corona virus pandemic I am in quarantine right now and it’s been a bit rough for me. My birthday was the 3rd of April right now it is the 11 of may. I was going to have a birthday party but we are not allowed, I wasn’t even allowed to see my family. </p>\n<p>I spend my time in quarantine by doing school work when it is finished I would play games go for walks around the street and that’s pretty much it I have nothing to do! You should feel grateful for how much you can do, I probably can’t do as much as you can. The virus is slowly going down and going up in different countries. We are only allowed to go to the shops for essential items and that’s it. I really do hope that this pandemic is gone soon! </p>\n<p>#StopTheSpread</p>\n <p>The Corona Virus changed my life because I can’t hang out with my friends and I can’t go to school. I don’t like how the Corona Virus has affected families all around the world, it has affected how I live my daily life, such as going to school, going to dance classes, hugging my friends and family, going to friends houses and friends coming to my house. I do not like being isolated either,we are being isolated in our homes because the Corona Virus spreads by coughing, touching and even breathing. A Lot of people are not going to work anymore as well, the only people who can go to work are needed, such as doctors and coal miners. </p>\n<p>One thing I like about the Corona Virus is that I don’t have to wake up early for school, I can do school work in my pajamas and that I can watch new shows on Netflix. Another thing that has affected me is that I can only have 2 people come to my house and my birthday is coming up and I cannot have people over because of the restrictions the government had put up for everyone’s safety. One thing I am looking forward to is when people can go traveling again because my family and I want to go on cruises with our friends. Speaking of cruises another thing I do not like is that some people from another country were stuck on a cruise ship for a month, they were not aloud to leave, luckily some people made entertainment packs for people. The cruise ship left Australia after being here for around 2 weeks. I really hope that everything gets better and I want doctors to find a cure, or at least something to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n <p>Coronavirus outbreak has been a challenging experience for us but a few positives have come out of it. Because of the lockdowns we get to spend more time with our family and have been doing more indoor activities like puzzles, cooking etc. We are also going on lots of walks and bike rides. It has been challenging because we cannot see our friends or even other family members, we have to follow social distancing (staying 1.5m away from people) rules and not allowed to travel overseas or even interstate.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is that schools, cafes and restaurants, pools, cinemas and many other business’ are closed. But the world is not only struggling from people dying, many people are losing their business’ because of lockdown. It all started in the city of Wuhan, China. A few months later it traveled around the world in nearly every country. Luckily here in Australia we haven’t been hit as hard as other countries. All sports are cancelled or postponed and many people have lost loved ones. People were panic buying (heavily stocking up) on toilet paper, hand sanitiser, masks, gloves and different types of foods. This pandemic has also gone through Easter, ANZAC Day and Mother’s Day.</p>\n<p>Hopefully all of this will end soon.</p>\n <p>I’m my opinion covid 19 did good and bad to me. It was fun at the start and changed over time. To start it off I was super excited to go do my dance workshop for my high school audition but that got cancelled which was very sad so they can now only base it on my solo. On the subject of dance I lost the chance to complete in all my competitions :( I even got entered into a competition in 8 sections which I was VERY excited for but sadly that got cancelled too.</p>\n<p>I think the worst thing for me was not being able to see all my friends the only thing that would help was being online with them or FaceTime which I am very thankful for at the moment. But 1 good thing was that I made a new friend who lives extremely close to me and she is very nice she was a good distraction from not seeing my other friends. I enjoyed spending lots more time with family and pets but at some states it got very annoying especially a brother that loves annoying you with whatever chance he has, He may be older than me but still loves it. I am a person who loves going outside but I was very great full to have the house I do because there are so many places to explore!!!. It was quite nice to get a break from everything because my life is very full on so In my opinion covid 19 was an interesting experience :)</p>\n <p>Corona Virus has been a challenging experience for us but a few positives have come out of it, Because of the lockdown we could not get out of the house, along time ago we heard on the news that a Chinese man had died from the Coronavirus, we thought it was nothing but more and more people started having it, it was spreading from country to country, state to state. Throughout the virus outbreak there were restrictions put in place by the government like staying 1.5 meters apart and only groups of 5 people aloud . A few months later the first death from the Coronavirus in Australia scared us, it soon became to spread across Australia. On the last Monday of school, me and my friends agreed to go home on Wednesday, That was the last day of school.</p>\n<p>The first day of lockdown it was fun, i got to do schoolwork from home, I would finish early and get to play games for the rest of the day, that day other people started going crazy for toilet paper and hand sanitiser, every day from then until the school holidays it was like that. The school holidays finally hit and i could just relax and play games, every day more and more people were going crazy for canned food, toilet paper and sanitiser. The first day of school after the holidays was weird, we had more work, every day I was getting border and border, running out of things to do, going on walks and bike rides to keep my fitness up, online classes and school work. After a while the restrictions started to ease and on the 3rd week of term two we finally got to school, i was so happy to finally see my friends.</p>\n <p>Living through the current pandemic of COVID-19 has changed my views as a Chinese Australian. For the first time, if a stranger was to speak to me on the streets of Newcastle, I was worried that they would blame me for COVID-19.  I had a roommate suspect me of having the COVID-19 even after I reassured him of no overseas travel experience and symptoms. His judgment was purely based on my Chinese appearance. My other friends of Asian appearance backgrounds have also experienced racism, some were refused onto the bus and others were refused to be served at a cafeteria. I remember browsing through many articles and one title caught my eye “ Melbourne health workers of Asian appearance report racist coronavirus attack”.  The situation described a mother refusing her child to be examined by a doctor of Asian appearance. </p>\n<p>I was frustrated at how people can link and blame the disease to an entire ethnicity. That a mother would not allow a doctor to treat her children purely due to appearance. As a future front line worker, I can’t imagine how I would feel being in the doctor’s position. This experience has taught me how dangerous and insecure one feels when being racial discrimination against.</p>\n <p>COVID19 is dumb it shouldn’t of happened. Life is boring because we can’t even really go out to the park or on holidays or even talk to our best friends face to face. But bad things come with good things in background. Some thing that I have enjoyed is playing with our pets, watching movies and the thought that we have done things no one has ever experienced before. When the restrictions are lifted I can do normal every day stuff like school, skateboarding, play gamer in real life and enjoy going to places like Sydney. Going to the shops is like going to the dream world.  But when I see my friends and family on FaceTime and other apps like that I get super duper happy. </p>\n <p>Some positive things about coronavirus have been that I have had more time to connect more with my family and spend more time with them. Usually my family and I would have events on and have no time to sit and talk and just relax but due to Coronavirus I have had time to do that. I have been able to do cooking, painting and go for walks with my family because of coronavirus. Since I haven’t been able to see my Grandparents, Cousins or Aunties and Uncles I have been able to do video calls with them.</p>\n<p>Some negative things are that I haven’t been able to connect with my friends and talk to them. I also haven’t been able to see other family members in case we get them sick or they get us sick. </p>\n<p>Coronavirus has been a hard and nervous experience for me because it is a bit worrying knowing that I could walk past or be in contact with someone with Covid- 19 and it’s been hard because I can’t do most of the things I usually could. It has just been the holidays and I didn’t get to go on a holiday or on road trips because in the holidays most of the restrictions got lifted. Over the holidays and April most shops closed but have started to open in May. Some shops that closed were clothing stores, hairdressers and all the other non-essential shops. </p>\n<p>I feel a bit lucky to be able to go through this experience because if anything like this happens in the future I will have experienced something like and know how to handle it. </p>\n <p>It is very difficult isolating and staying at home. We were told by the Government to stay at home unless we had to go to work, to buy necessities and to go to school. Some families chose to keep their children at home, so keep them safe. I was learning from home during this time and it was nice because everyone had more time to be active. Plenty of stores and shops are closed because of the virus, but when the restrictions get lifted I will be happy because we can do more things. one of the first things I am going to do is go to my Grandmothers place and doing things that we haven’t had a chance to do.</p>\n <p>I didn’t know the virus started until it said on the news in late February. Even though it started in December I was shocked to know what had happened and then later in the year it was getting worse and worse many had died and millions around the world had been infected eventually it got more worse than the Spanish flu. </p>\n<p>COVID 19 was very deadly but there were some good things about it like more time spendable with your family which is very good so you can play with them or watch movies. You have more time to socialise and go online to see your friends without getting fined for going to close. Also I am thankful for actually having a family at this time. </p>\n<p>My favourite thing is that the restrictions changed so you can have 2 people visit your house at a time and I could finally see my friends in real life on the day we’re all year sixes were aloud to come to school. Some bad things are that there are limited activities to do outside apart from bushwalking and camping. Also we can’t go near people “1.5meters” the government and prime minister says which is true because if it is too close then you can spread bacteria. Plus all hospitals are getting really full around the world. </p>\n<p>But sadly all people are having to stay home from work and that stops them from earning money too. But some shops are still open which is very good if your low on food and I don’t know when it will end but I hope it ends in about a few months. So there are good things and bad thing but just so you know just hope it will end eventually and be happy bye bye.</p>\n <p>Covid- 19 has effected many people all around the world and is a very scary situation. Loads of people are horribly scared and are stuck in isolation so they don’t get or spread coronavirus. Parks, pools, shops and schools are closed and there’s nothing to do since you are stuck in isolation and quarantine. </p>\n<p>Online school is sometimes hard for kids because if you don’t understand anything it takes them quite a long time to reply to your message or email unless your on a zoom meeting. Zoom meetings are used for online school as it’s like FaceTime but for school. </p>\n<p>Some good things about covid-19 is you get to spend time on things you haven’t got the chance to do, like cleaning your room or even your whole house! In isolation you can also enjoy time by yourself away from everybody. Covid-19 was a very hard time for us all around the world. But things will slowly get better and come back into shape.</p>\n <p>YEAR 2020</p>\n<p>What’s Covid-19? Covid-19 or coronavirus is an infectious disease That spread from China. It was suspected that it started when someone ate a pangolin from an exotic fresh market.</p>\n<p>PROS</p>\n<p>&#8211; more time with family<br />\n&#8211; more time at home </p>\n<p>CONS</p>\n<p>&#8211; less social interactions<br />\n&#8211; less exercise<br />\n&#8211; no restaurants<br />\n&#8211; no outside events<br />\n&#8211; no going outside unless necessary<br />\n&#8211; doctors/nurses work more</p>\n<p>And it was found that coronavirus is more deadly to elders in our community.</p>\n<p>How does Coronavirus effect my life?</p>\n<p>Coved-19 effects my life by not being able to go to school or going out anywhere with my parents.</p>\n<p>Recently Covid-19 in Australia is not as bad as other countries, and soon we will be able to go back to our normal lives.</p>\n<p>Although Covid-19 hardly affects children it still scares me how contagious this disease is, And makes me hope that no other outbreak like this or worse, will ever start again.</p>\n <p>Woah. This is so crazy. People are stuck in their houses and can’t go outside. All this has happened because of COVID-19. I have stopped going to school 5 weeks ago. My Mum is a nurse and goes to the hospital a lot and I don’t see her a lot as well. This experience is new to all of us. (Unless you were alive in 1918). I have been able to FaceTime my friends more and I don’t usually FaceTime. </p>\n<p>I taught my brother how to ride a bike and taught my sister how to do a backhand spring. I have rode my bike a lot as well. But, all my basketball is cancelled. And basketball is all I do! At least I still get some practise in. There is a loss of food, hand sanitiser and (you might think it’s funny) toilet paper! No one about COVID-19 and didn’t effect us till February. Family’s are unable to visit for Easter and Mother’s Day. I am normally stressed doing everything but in lockdown I have learned to relax a bit more. </p>\n<p>All the students have been home schooled and doing school work on their iPads and laptops . I have been stuck inside and bored with nothing to do, I learned to do more things like cook pasta with meatballs and mince. COVID-19 has changed the world to teach people about being sanitary. So many things are cancelled like sport, meetings, gatherings and so much more! Playground and pubs are closed and taped off. This app called zoom is used for my basketball training. People are scared and worried but safe as well. In 15 years I will be on the basketball court thinking about the 2020 crisis. When we are all older, we will still remember COVID-19.It is crazy!</p>\n <p>Covid-19 started in December. I had to stop going to school on Covid-19 because I didn’t want to get sick. When it was on we had limited activities and we had to stay 1.5m away from people. And I’m also happy about Covid-19 because we got to spend way more time with my family. But you can still go to school if you’re parents had to go to work. And we also had other ways to do our work, by doing it at home. I have been doing on my iPad on google classroom and my class have been doing a ZOOM meeting.</p>\n <p>When you live in a household at a young age with parents,  99% of  the  time you cannot control yourself over this dictatorship, but right now,  you cannot get ahead of yourself 100%, due to the current restrictions over COVID-19. The only thing that I guess is ok with the disease is that it isn’t a ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE. I do use that term to calm myself down, but when you cannot play footy due to the current ‘no contact’ rule, it is very hard. </p>\n<p>But how did we get to this point, to the point that all countries except for Turkmenistan are in danger due to the dangerous, life threatening disease entering inside what are now closed borders. Well&#8230; it went like this, in December of 2019, there were many reports that many people were coughing and splattering due to the newborn disease known as COVID-19. None of us Aussies really cared, well, we did, but we didn’t know that we would get to the point that we had to brace ourselves for the restrictions that would take place, in fact,  no one knew. However, around March 2020, out of nowhere, the restrictions came, our borders closed, and the government immediately took action. Right now, as of May 11 2020, the restrictions have eased, however COVID-19, is still, a scare to the world. </p>\n<p>All I can say is&#8230; I cannot wait for a normal life.</p>\n <p>So far the year of 2020 has been quite a roller coaster of emotions because of the Corona Virus. At first I was really scared that I would not be able to meet up with my friends for a while but, I was really afraid that my grandmother  might get sick. But as time passed I became fond of my new life style, and I new the routine like the back of my hand. </p>\n<p>Before this whole experience my brother and sister were not always the closest and so we took the time we had to grow a better bond and we did. I am also not loosing out on to much exercise because we made our very own ninja warrior course out of our supplies at home and the terrain in my yard. Another thing I very much enjoy is the comfort of my own home and my little dog, he is always just wandering around and being as friendly as he can. </p>\n<p>Once this experience is over I really look forward to going to a friend’s house again, plus once this is done I get to start my sports again. And last but definitely not least I wish to go back to the normal school ways, because in this time the teachers have been very considerate with our work and given us less that normal.</p>\n <p>Dear NSW state library, </p>\n<p>During COVID-19 i have felt all types of feelings of what i like about COVID and what I don’t. I like spending time with my family because normally we’re always doing other stuff but during Covid-19 our relationship as a family has grown. During Covid-19 i like  my school work and education because I finish super early like 11-12 o’clock and it’s awesome. The negative side of Covid-19 is i don’t like staying inside cause i am definitely not an inside person. Also I don’t like how i don&#8217;t get to see my family and friends as much as i did before. It’s going to be so good once life gets back to normal.</p>\n <p>Corona Virus </p>\n<p>Since this horrid, disastrous virus our world has been a quiet place. It has been a huge journey for everyone. I believe it has changed my perspective of our health and the germs around us. I believe it is a warning, telling us to really think about our own health, simple things like washing hands and taking care of your self. </p>\n<p>This virus has got us in lock down and it feels like your captured away and seperate from everyone. I have felt bored but also glad that I get to spend time with my beautiful family. It’s also very overwhelming for everyone because we all want our families to stay safe and especially the Elderly to not get this horrible virus. I have felt very confused but there is always a positive and mine is that I get to spend time out in my backyard more and that my family is always with me and also that I get to enjoy walking down my paths more. </p>\n<p>There is also always negatives, like not being able to see friends and family and things like celebrations being called off. I am excited for there to be a cure so that our world can go back to having fun with things and enjoying events. I am also every excited for it to be legal to see all my family. Corona virus has been a very different experience for me for this is the first time that I have been through a virus that has spread across the world.</p>\n <p>COVID-19&#8230;COVID-19 is making me go CRAZY there’s not much to do at all. Well I am going to tell you how I have experienced COVID-19. For starters I really miss going out with family and friends. I also miss seeing my teacher but here are some good thing about this virus. I’ve been working at home, been riding my bike more often spending time with family and pets FaceTiming my friends heaps more. I’m kinda exited to see my family but a bit nervous.  </p>\n<p>In case it harms anyone in my family. I hope it stops really soon. </p>\n <p>Covid-19 changed my life because I can not play soccer and I can not go motobike riding but the biggest thing is I can’t see my friends. I am lucky we have the internet so I can call or text my friends. I have also learnt how to bake and cook and also with my online work I finished early every day.</p>\n<p>I felt scared and worried that one of my family members will get sick and die but lucky no one in my family has caught it.</p>\n <p>The corona virus has been going on for a few months now this had made me feel really tired. Recently I’ve been playing my ps4 with my mates it’s fun being able to play with them online. I’m really tired of quarantine and not going out. We just got back  to school but it’s only one day a week and the whole school isn’t here it’s just a few classes. I hope this will be lifted soon. People’s businesses are going downhill and we just got the hairdressers again. </p>\n <p>Covid 19 has been hard for me because we can’t go family walking. There is limited food that we can take from the supermarket there is no more sports like soccer, footy, basketball and even tennis. When Covid 19 finishes I will be going straight away with my family to the pools having a swim and I will be playing soccer once again with my friends.  I hope this virus finishes quick.</p>\n <p>THE GREAT PANIC</p>\n<p>During the great toilet paper panic<br />\nthat gripped this fine nation in 2020,<br />\nI saw two women, fear in their eyes,<br />\nclutching hard-won supermarket treasure<br />\nto their breasts with both arms,<br />\nas if cradling babies:<br />\ntwo rolls of kitchen paper each.</p>\n<p>Faces hopeful, they asked<br />\n‘We’re looking for hand sanitiser?’<br />\nA weary chemist’s assistant shrugged.<br />\n‘Nope. None. We’ve run out.’<br />\nShe had answered this query all day.</p>\n<p>The women stood there, desolate.<br />\n\tWhere could they turn now?</p>\n<p>Soon there’ll be furtive touts on street corners<br />\n\tselling contraband tissues,<br />\nif only you can pay the price;<br />\nor peddling tales of Aladdin’s caves:<br />\n\t\twarehouses stuffed to bursting with loo paper,<br />\n\t\t\tvats of hand-made sanitiser,<br />\n\tto tease our fearful dreams.</p>\n<p>Gone are the heady days of Australia’s gold rush.<br />\n\tThe great toilet paper rush of 2020<br />\ngathers momentum. Then<br />\nthe people will revolt. Their flag?<br />\n\t\t\t\tAn honoured cross of white paper,<br />\n\t\t\t\t  \tstitched sheet by perforated sheet,<br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEureka stars of soft white tissue.<br />\nAnd the toilet rolls will all be liberated,<br />\nreturn to the longing, empty shelves<br />\n\tto patriotic cheers and tears of joy,<br />\nso anxious women can smile again.</p>\n<p>But like its precursor revolution in Ballarat,<br />\nthis stand  will inspire valiant deeds<br />\n\tand the sad slaughter of innocents.<br />\n\t\tWhen will the madness end?</p>\n <p>Dear NSW state library,</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has been life changing. There has been good reasons and bad reasons. Some of the good reasons are; I have had more time to draw, ride my motorbike, go for bike rides and play on my ps4. I have a lot more time to play with my dog since I am not at school and some of the bad reasons; I can’t go out to dinner with my family, I can’t see my relatives, I hate being bored but since COVID-19 I have always remembered to wash my hands more often. All of the parks have been closed but we were able to FaceTime my family (virtual FaceTime) It has been a pretty tough time but most of us survived and got through it but when you actually think about it doesn’t seem that bad.</p>\n <p>Covid-19 has been a journey for everyone! It’s included many negatives but has also included many positives! During this time I believe it has brought many families closer and reconnected many, but as well as bringing them it torn many apart! I have enjoyed lockdown because I finish online schooling early and get to spend much more time with family on the trampoline and outside in general! </p>\n<p>Although lockdown has been pretty hard as I can’t see family and friends and not being able to see loved ones has been really difficult and I miss them loads! During isolation the only thing keeping my sanity is going for walks and bike rides down my street! Something about isolation I like is being able to learn skills like cooking, acro and being more independent as well as trying to work well with siblings! </p>\n<p>Isolation has helped me realise how much my parents do for me and helping with the chores around the house is really important as they would do anything for us! I am looking forward to when the rules drop as we may be able to see people again and some places may reopen! I personally had my 12th birthday in iso! A few days before my birthday it was announced that we could see some family members, this was truely an amazing present as my grandparents are important to me and I love seeing them on my birthday! </p>\n<p>Personally I don’t mind isolation with all the online schooling as my teachers are very organised and we even do Zooms every once in a while for checkups and so we can see others faces again! One thing that’s very annoying is the low stock and how everyone is going Absolutely crazy about stocking up on essential items! </p>\n <p>Dear NSW State Library,</p>\n<p>COVID 19 has been bad for me because I am a sporty and energetic kid that loves footy. Unfortunately everything related to sports have been cancelled. There are no sports like NRL and basketball. </p>\n<p>But some good things are that I can still exercise on my bike and take my dog for a walk. But not being able to go to the public park around the corner from my house is bad because I like going on the swings. Playing my ps4 is pretty good because there’s nothing else to do around this time. </p>\n <p>Year in at school Yr 6</p>\n<p>Hi I’m Oliver I have some bad things that happened and good things that happened in the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The bad things about Coronavirus are not seeing my friends, not being able to learn how to ride my motorised scooter and not going out.</p>\n<p>The good things have been not going to school, more time to play games. I finish my work early and I learn how to do tricks on my bike. </p>\n <p>What I haven’t liked about COVID-19: I haven’t liked not being able to talk to my friends in real life and not being able to do dancing at my dance school and having to do it at home which was annoying because I have older brothers that annoy me a lot.</p>\n<p>Things I have enjoyed about COVID-19: I have liked finishing my school work early and not having to wake up to early to get ready for school. I’ve also like FaceTiming friends during the day and having virtual sleepovers (where you FaceTime and watch movies until you fall asleep).</p>\n<p>What I’m excited about when the restrictions are lifted: I’m excited for going to the shops, going to my friends house and going back to dancing.</p>\n<p>How am I feeling at this point in time: in this point in time I’m feeling pretty bored after finishing my school work early but I have been outside a lot more and I’ve kind of enjoyed staying home, talking to my friends and going on bike rides as well as dancing from home.</p>\n <p>The Corona Virus has been scary. Watching the news each night is like watching a horror movie, but instead of a happy ending it goes on and on. People say that there will be a vaccine in 18 months others say 2/3 years. Something that I like about about quarantine is that I get heaps more exercise and learn to appreciate the things I have ( or order some stuff online lol ). I also feel that working from home has taught me independence. Things I don’t like is no contact and social distancing because you have to raise your voice just to talk to friends. I’m looking forward to getting out of quarantine and being fresh and ready for high school.</p>\n <p>What have I done since lockdown began?</p>\n<p>No ping pong, no croquet, no singing, no dance!<br />\nWhat’s a girl go’nna do to fill the expanse<br />\nof time stretching forward for maybe six months<br />\ntill this virulent virus loses its punch.</p>\n<p>Number one is to zoom, to stay in contact<br />\nwith mates, to ensure that we don’t react<br />\nadversely to such isolating restrictions<br />\nand keep our mood up, away from depression.</p>\n<p>This screen mode’s essential to keep us amused<br />\nBut when we try singing together and fused<br />\na cacophony of noise, not much hope for “in sync”!<br />\nIt sounds like we’ve spent a few days on the drink.</p>\n<p>The next thing is walking each day, round the bay<br />\n because most of my games we’re forbidden to play.<br />\nIt’s so tempting to put too much food on the plate<br />\nand important to try and maintain the same weight.</p>\n<p>But golf is a yes, so it’s great to get out<br />\non the course when it’s fine and swing, without doubt.<br />\nThe game is adjusted but works all the same<br />\nand stops all of us golf nuts from going insane<br />\nNew activities I’m finding, like trying to blend a<br />\nmix of materials to restore their lost splendour<br />\nby sewing In patchwork, arranging position<br />\nto make up some covers for dining chair cushions.</p>\n<p>Then something which comes right out of thin air<br />\nare verses and rhymes to be written  down there<br />\nof this moment in time, so unprecedented<br />\nwe hope in our lifetime to be not repeated.</p>\n <p>Today was the first day i entered my school gates in weeks, having to get a sudden change from what i have been used to was quite strange. Getting up at 7:00 for the first time since school was still on, i put on my school uniform instead of staying in my pj&#8217;s all day. I had to do my hair, look nice, and i had to put an effort in my physical appearance. </p>\n<p>I have to sit in class and listen to teachers instead of sitting in my bed getting comfy for the day of &#8220;school&#8221;. this corona virus pandemic was my wake up call to how lazy and ignorant we can be. Why does it have take a pandemic to talk to my loved ones two or three hours away? why does it take a sickness to miss our elders? this pandemic is a wake up call for all of us and just that should tell you what our world is now.</p>\n <p>Dear diary,</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been 6 week&#8217;s and I&#8217;m finaly at school, I&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment my whole entire life. It&#8217;s been really boring at home, well not boring it&#8217;s just that online learning is EXTREMELY HARD and I can&#8217;t really focus because there are so many distractions. I miss interacting with my friends because that&#8217;s the only way I really focus. </p>\n<p>Apart from online learning at home it&#8217;s been the best, spending time with my family and learning new things with my family. </p>\n <p>Isolation has been alright I watched a lot of netflix and my favourite series and movie was bad boys and the indian detective and also I was facetiming all my friends and a couple of times I was facetiming my grandparents to see how they were.</p>\n<p>I also was going to the park every day of isolation because we are at home for a very long time so I&#8217;ve been going to the park every day to keep fit.</p>\n <p>Hello, welcome to my Diary Files ♡</p>\n<p>During the online school times I did most of the work but not being at school with my teacher was hard. Being home was also fun because I got to bake loads of yummy cookies and cakes and different foods. When it was finally time to go back to school I was super excited to see all my friends and talk too.</p>\n <p>Positives &amp; Negatives:  </p>\n<p>Being in isolation has been really tough. There are positives and negatives. I started school today, not knowing what will happen. I had so many mixed emotions, anxious, nervous, excited, glad, for so many reasons. </p>\n<p>I had to do online learning for 7 weeks. Again, there were positives and negatives. During this time there are many positives and negatives. It is our choice whether to look at the negatives and positives. </p>\n <p>With restrictions in NSW very slowly starting to lift, I found myself still very mindful of my surroundings outside my home and of course while visiting my 80 year old mother and 79 year old father. Keeping social distancing will become part of our lives now. As our Premier &#8211; Gladys Berejiklian said this week &#8211; &#8220;we need to all assume we have corona virus and we should assume that the person we come across outside our home also have the corona virus&#8221; This to me makes sense, as social distancing will stop the spread.</p>\n<p>I am able to still go into the office, while the rest of the staff have decided to work from home. So, basically I am in the office with one other person and thankfully we have our own offices and keeping a safe distance is easy to maintain. So work life for me has not changed.</p>\n<p>My husband works for Australia&#8217;s airline and with over 30,000 people having been stood down, he is lucky to be still going into the office on his rostered days (he is a shift worker). With the people being stood down, we are hoping that everyone is back at their jobs when this is all over, as we are going to need every single one of those people to get the airline up and running again.</p>\n<p>My son (26) has unfortunately lost his job, but funnily enough not because of Corona virus &#8211; his employer was bought out by another larger company, and this puts him is a position now where he is looking for employment as are half the people in our country. I hope he finds something soon.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope a vaccine is found and we can all resume our normal lives&#8230;. whatever normal is.</p>\n <p>My dog loves pandemics.</p>\n<p>She has three people loving her, constantly.<br />\n(We all need the pats/We all need the cuddles.)<br />\nShe&#8217;s never walked so far in her life.<br />\nShe&#8217;s seeing new places, new parks, sniffing new smells.<br />\nThe air is cleaner &#8211; she can breathe better.<br />\nShe can hear better.<br />\nThe noisy things flying through the air that sort of hurt her ears have flown away.<br />\nThe roads are safer.<br />\nPeople in the parks give her space. But they&#8217;re friendlier.<br />\nThere are lots of dogs to meet. More every day.<br />\nWhere have they been?<br />\nEveryone&#8217;s home.<br />\nLoving her.</p>\n<p>My dog loves pandemics.</p>\n <p>12:11pm<br />\nby Paris Xanthoudakis<br />\nMarist Catholic College Penshurst- yr7</p>\n<p>COVID-19 was massive. all I remember was being picked up from school and my mum balling her eyes out . all she said was &#8221;I think I have been exposed to someone with corona&#8221;&#8230; and my heart dropped. we all went into isolation 2 weeks before everyone else did. she went and got tested straight and luckily she was tested negative. it was so hard being in iso, especially since all my friends were still at school.</p>\n<p>online learning was so hard. my school didn&#8217;t end up doing zoom calls, and my parents were working full time so I had no one to assist me. I was receiving 35 emails a day.. having new things posted on compass 24/7.. and things on google classroom posted and expected to be handed in by the next day were so hard.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t go see my grandparents because everyone was being cautious. easter was so hard.. usually every easter we would all get together with all my cousins and all the fam, but this year it was very different and a whole lot lonely.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t meet up with my friends at all, so instead, I had to facetime them. We had Netflix parties and we joined random cahoots.</p>\n<p>apart from being lonely, it was a good time to relax and reflect on everything that I grateful for. I am really glad that I am back at school.</p>\n <p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>Isolation has been a pretty tough time for me as online school is a bit challenging. In my opinion, school face to face is much better then being isolated from my friends, teachers and school. My emails were blowing up from the school work we were getting, but I managed to keep up. When Online school was over it was great! I had more time to relax and binge watch my all time favourite show, The Vampire Diaries. I also tried new things during the free time I had at home. I baked a chocolate mug cake that was actually so delicious! I also tried coffee for the first time, I think I have a bit of an addiction now. Sometimes, I would go to the park and play some soccer if nobody was around, as you know, social distancing and all. I also think that 2020 has been an extremely bad year! But, our earth is starting to heal and things are getting better.</p>\n <p>It was two months that I was at home and it was finally time that I arrive back at school. The amount of things I did at home was outstanding. I binge watched shows, cook and baked things that I have never done before, use zoom to contact with my friends and I even did lots of fitness to keep my body in the correct shape.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I wish I was still being at home but just doing what I want to do, not doing any work, but then I realised that the thing I was using which was technology but all I really wanted to do was see my friends and go out to places where I wanna go out. due to being in isolation, I wasn&#8217;t able to go out anywhere with my friends. I was planning to go out with my friends like go shopping, have sleepovers, have pool parties, and way more things that I wanted to do. This letter is filled up with all of my anger just splashed onto a piece of paper with bunch of words. This is all i have to say&#8230;</p>\n <p>Dear Future,</p>\n<p>Today I went back to school after 7 weeks in isolation.7 WEEKS!.<br />\nThe stores are finally becoming more normal, I can see toilet paper, hand sanitizer, masks, gloves and soaps.</p>\n<p>The school holidays were different this term(term 1-2).I wasn&#8217;t allowed to have sleepovers see my friends go to the movies or do anything! The rules were lifted last week on friday as a part of the 3 stages from Scott Morrison that is helping us get back to normal. School online was horrible, i missed stuff and understood the work but I realised that technology is great but what I really craved was human interaction.  My grades went down because I was unable to concentrate at home.</p>\n<p>Seeing my family was hard but we went and talked anyway. What really intrigued me was the fact that I needed a global pandemic to happen for me to reach out to my cousins who are my age who live in America and facetime. Altogether coronavirus is something I will never forget.</p>\n <p>Today was the first day in 7 weeks since i have gone to school , I was really excited to go back to school and see all of my friends , and i am really happy to get back to learning in the classroom.<br />\ni didn&#8217;t really enjoy online school.</p>\n <p>I get woke by the screaming alarm in my ear, I reach over to turn it off as I lay there and the air around me grows colder. I wish to stay in bed forever but I know soon enough the lesson will start. I force my body to get out of bed and get ready, as I reef off the sheets on top of me the frozen air pierces my skin.</p>\n<p>Once I get up I go outside to eat breakfast with my dog and the birds. I go down the back to feed the chickens and collect eggs, the frosty ground melts under my step and the sun gives me warmth. I feed the dog and get my things ready for the online class.</p>\n<p>I wait staring at my computer for the class to start. There it is the only reason to be awake, I click on the chat, mute my microphone and turn off the camera. The teacher starts marking the roll to make sure everyone is there, before she starts going on about the lesson. There are so many distractions around me and I try my hardest to stay focused, the work is mocking me and I try to motivate myself to do it all. I email the work to the teacher and go back to bed to watch Netflix and eat. This continues on during the day.</p>\n<p>Finally my parents and brothers get home from work as essential workers, we all sit down, have dinner and go to bed ready to do it all again tomorrow.</p>\n <p>Never thought I&#8217;d ever see this phase of life. I&#8217;ve learnt a lot over the past few days or months.</p>\n<p>I have reconnected with myself, on what it is to be a human being. I have connected more with family and friends, cut down my social media in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s. Most importantly, have started a happiness space with my wife and friends. It is helping me stay positive, do my workouts, be healthy. I also miss my 4-month old baby and wife, who are stuck in India. Hoping to see them soon. Miss them so much.</p>\n<p>Finally, a hearty thank you to all the medical staff and each and everyone, who is working to keep the world running. Cheers to you all !!</p>\n <p>Oh it&#8217;s the weekend! And it&#8217;s almost finished&#8230;</p>\n<p>Wait&#8230;are weekends still a thing?</p>\n<p>Oh, it&#8217;s also Mother&#8217;s Day around the world. Everyday, I think, ever since the various stages of lockdowns in the world, most of us have been in touch with our mothers &#8212; perhaps for some like me, even more often than in the past few years. So Mother&#8217;s Day today is not only celebrated in quite a limited way &#8212; social distancing for us, but still in isolation for other parts of the world. But has also sort of waned in excitement as we may have been with our mums &#8212; albeit virtually &#8212; for many weeks leading up to this day. Or maybe it&#8217;s just me. There&#8217;s really no shopping for presents or anything like that, and we just had simple breakfast at my in-laws house.</p>\n<p>I am a mum to a young child (who actually told me to add here that we didn&#8217;t give him time on the iPad today! hahaha). And everyday with him now has really been like Mother&#8217;s Day. He will no longer go back to school for the rest of the year as we have registered him with the Home Education Unit. At first, it felt weird having him around and stressfully trying to &#8220;school&#8221; him at home. But now that we have moved forward and moved away from &#8220;school&#8221;, the three of us are just learning and living. And we are all learning with each other! Time spent as a family is really priceless! And we are just happy that we get to do that everyday now &#8212; mother&#8217;s day or no mother&#8217;s day, weekend or no weekend. ;-)</p>\n <p>As a student my life has been a wild mess, it was difficult and I think it has damaged not just my school work but everyone in school right now.</p>\n<p>School holidays was different I couldn&#8217;t go out, I couldn&#8217;t see family and I felt alone without any friends and family around.</p>\n<p>This is my first day of school for 6 weeks now and it was awkward talking to my friends and teachers.</p>\n<p>Easter and Mother&#8217;s day was annoying because I couldn&#8217;t see anyone, for example my family was alone on Easter and it felt like a normal day.</p>\n<p>Now I zoom my aunty every day and my mum and dad zoom their friends for a drink and talk every week.</p>\n <p>It&#8217;s been ages since I&#8217;ve seen anyone during this pandemic and everything has been hard. Schools have started to become online, people have relied on technology for a while, but for me, I&#8217;ve been binging Rick and Morty on Netflix and have been playing a lot of videogames, I&#8217;ve been keeping in touch with my family relatives all across Sydney.</p>\n <p>I am a student and it is my first day back at school from online learning, it has been six weeks from the last time I went to school.</p>\n<p>Mothers day was very different instead of my whole family together we had around 3 families at my grandmas&#8217; house. But personally my holidays weren&#8217;t that different I stayed inside the whole time. The start of term two was different but still good.</p>\n <p>My name is Hailee and I&#8217;m 12 years old. I am in year 7 at Marist Catholic College Penshurst. I have been in isolation for 7 weeks.</p>\n<p>Isolation hasn&#8217;t been easy. I am an active girl and I have only been outside the house to walk the dog for exercise of a morning, when there are not to many people around. Although I have already missed an entire netball season and lots of Physical Culture lessons, I feel like I am luckier then most kids my age because I have a big backyard where I can play and run with the dog for exercise.</p>\n<p>I miss my friends and I miss my team sports but I know I have to put my health and safety and the health of my family first. My living situation is a bit different to some others. My Pop lives with us and he&#8217;s in his 70s and my little sister is 6 and is a coeliac. That is an autoimmune disease. I can&#8217;t risk getting out to help Mum with the groceries or to see my friends. Even now with phased schooling, I can&#8217;t attend and I am still learning online.</p>\n<p>I have been learning online for 5 weeks. At first it was hard, scary even. I felt nervous and anxious every time I had to complete a task online. It was all new. I started to understand though, that every kid in NSW was in the same situation as me.</p>\n<p>Isolation hasn&#8217;t been all bad. I have learned a lot about myself and my family. It has made me value them more.</p>\n<p>I know Covid-19 will end and isolation will lift. I also know that my generation has made history during this time. I am proud to be apart of that.</p>\n <p>Every day is the same, wake up, eat, get dressed and begin my online schooling. At first, I was excited. It was something new, I wouldn&#8217;t have to go to school, I could binge watch and relax. I would accomplish things and go to the beach.</p>\n<p>How wrong I was.</p>\n<p>Every day is the same now. Nothing new. I see my friends through the screen. I can&#8217;t touch them. Hug them. Comfort them.</p>\n<p>I am trapped. Trapped in a world that has gone mad. I feel trapped inside myself. My house had become an alien world. School feels like it&#8217;s on another planet.</p>\n<p>Every day is the same. The same. The same&#8230;</p>\n<p>I miss connecting with people. Now I only connect to the internet.</p>\n<p>Nothing new. It&#8217;s all the same. Boredom is life now. I can no longer leave the house unless it&#8217;s necessary.</p>\n<p>The pixels on my screen are all I have to remind me of my friends. So much I could have done. The best months of my life are being wasted. By doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>Everything is the same.<br />\nThe same.<br />\nThe same.<br />\nNothing new.<br />\nNothing different.<br />\nIt&#8217;s all the same&#8230;</p>\n <p>Stuck in isolation for 7 weeks finally coming back to school after all of this, it has definitely left a mark in my mind. We couldn&#8217;t even see the nonnas we had to chat from the bottom of the balcony, not even a hug we couldn&#8217;t get too close either. I am very grateful that I can see my friends today it&#8217;s very cool after 8 weeks we go back to school seeing all our friends and all the teachers. It&#8217;s the best.</p>\n <p>Today is officially my 52nd day in isolation. I haven&#8217;t left the house or seen any family or friends since the 21st of March. Life has been tough but I managed to get through it with my family. I have a family of six so there is not a lot of room. Every night we fight about what movie to watch. Being one of the middle children means that generally I am overwritten by my younger brothers and my older sister.</p>\n<p>Although the current times, I believe that some countries will rise as others fall. What I mean by that is some countries have greatly overcome the pandemic such as Italy and some will be recovering for decades after the pandemic such as the US.</p>\n <p>My husband and I are both teachers. He is full-time and I am mostly casual.</p>\n<p>We have both had work the whole time the Covid-19 virus has been affecting NSW and so our 3 kids have also been going to school. It is hard for them, they are at school but most or their friends are not. It has been good for them to get out of the house though.</p>\n<p>We have all felt very safe in our area of SW Sydney. We were all at home for the 2.5 weeks of school holidays. We are blessed with a big house and a yard of 3/4 acre with beautiful big trees and lots of space. It was not hard to be home.</p>\n<p>After living in Tanzania for the last 4.5 years, we are used to being a family, amusing ourselves, playing games together and being creative with our time. For us, the whole situation has not been too bad. We do miss seeing friends and family and being able to be hospitable in our home. Normally we love to invite people over and share meals together.</p>\n<p>We reached out to our local community by starting a FB page. Not many have been in need around us though. We really enjoyed joining with the community in celebrating ANZAC day at the end of our drive. It was eerie, beautiful all at the same time. W</p>\n<p>e love doing church services via Zoom. People are interviewed about their lives and we get further into their story than we do over the usual cup of tea after the service. We have had many &#8216;positives&#8217;.</p>\n <p>Today was the first day i had gone to school in like 6 weeks ! There was hardly anyone here as many people stayed home because of the pandemic. It was nice to be out of the house but pretty stressful having to see my teachers and fellow students. At home it was like a ghost town, no one was on the streets, everyone was inside. </p>\n<p>I had nothing to do because school work was boring, Netflix ended up getting boring, the tv and xbox, boring. I had nothing to do the entire time. It was like a zombie apocalypse and we had to hide. I sat at home for nearly 2 months doing nothing, driving me crazy.</p>\n <p>I arrived at school for the first time in 7 weeks, the cold air slaps me in the face and wakes me up. As I walk to my locker I see groups of people talking non-stop. Everyone is catching up with each other.</p>\n<p>The teachers summon us to head to our pastoral class. We stand there in the warm sun running our mouths. Our teachers don&#8217;t bother trying to shut us up.</p>\n<p>I contemplate returning to school, it is good to see my friends but it isn&#8217;t good to see some people (know what I&#8217;m saying).</p>\n<p>While I am in math feeling stupid I get called to answer a question, I have a mind blank WHAT IS 14 &#8211; 5?! A boy laughs at me, I answer the question and slump back into my chair.</p>\n<p>Then he gets asked a question, he stumbles over his words and can&#8217;t answer. I give him some karma and laugh back at him. the class snickers.</p>\n<p>The clown deserved it.</p>\n <p>Our prime minister mentioned on Friday that we can’t keep hiding under the covers, but today that is exactly what I’m doing. I feel so fortunate that in this country we are able to now talk about the way out of this time, when so many others haven’t been so lucky, but I’m also not ready.</p>\n<p>My partner and I are now planning our wedding for a third time, after being affected by both the bushfires and COVID-19, and had things gone the way we had hoped, then we would be honeymooning in Europe right now, having the backpacking trip we had dreamed of and saved for, before coming home to start a family together. I feel frustration and sadness that these parts of my life are in a holding pattern, whilst also gratitude and excitement that I will hopefully still get to have these things in my future.</p>\n<p>The probable reason why I’m hiding today is because more kids return to school, and today I’m feeling like a fraud. It is my job to counsel children who are scared but right now I am scared, and most of the time I can find a way to put my own feelings aside and help them, but as I write this with broken-skinned hands I know that my OCD behaviours have returned in ways that will be both adaptive and maladaptive for me during and beyond this time.</p>\n<p>So while I’m so thankful for the way that our country responded quickly to this crisis, I’m also sad, angry, and scared that the things I wanted most were missed and the thing I needed most, time to hide away, wasn’t possible as a frontline worker. So today I stayed in bed at home, as others celebrate being able to leave theirs soon.</p>\n <p>(Shopping &#8211; part 1)<br />\nHave I been watching too many horror movies? I was beginning to feel we were the only two people left alive. But no, I was wrong. I ventured out today, to do a little shopping. There were a few cars on our local road, presumably driven by live humans. There was even mail in the box, indicating someone had been as close as our front gate in the last week. Saw a few 18 wheelers on the highway, hopefully delivering toilet paper. (Do you know that USAns, who don’t have the word ‘toilet’ in their vocabulary, call it ‘bathroom tissue’?)</p>\n<p>Anyway, got to the supermarket, parked my car at least 1.5mts from the next car, thereby using two parking places, donned my mask and ventured forth with my reusable shopping bags. Grabbed a trolley (no wipes on offer) and started to browse the near empty shelves.</p>\n<p>Stocked up with the essentials such as ice cream, chips and soft drinks. I considered these essential for two reasons. Firstly with so much TV viewing I need lots of snacks and secondly, as I am only permitted by Scotty to shop for essentials I declared them such.</p>\n<p>Just as well I didn’t need toot paper, eggs or pasta as there were none. I mainly went for fresh greens and yes there were choices. I was afforded the luxury of choosing between bok choy and celery as the only greens available. Partner had asked me to get him some plums. They had two left at $7.99 a kilo.<br />\n(To be continued)</p>\n <p>It’s 7.30am. I’ve been up an hour and already I have poured the chicken stock I made with last night’s roast chicken carcass down the sink, having left it on the bench to cool and forgotten it overnight.  It sat in the grey light of the morning,  an accusation of waste and neglect. I poured it out and took the soggy remains to the bin outside.  It’s rubbish collection day.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I read somewhere it has been 7 weeks since restrictions began.</p>\n<p>Yesterday my eight year old daughter wrote a line as part of her remote learning English lesson, that said: The kids at my school used to play chase (before the virus came).<br />\nAnd I wanted to cry.</p>\n<p>I made toast and eggs for breakfast for the kids, a pot of leaf tea for M and I, and soaked homemade muesli.  The eggs come from a friend’s farm, delivered once a week along with veggies and fruit.  I ‘pay’ for this on a barter system.  I manage their website.  It’s working well.  Most things are homemade now. my husband began making sourdough bread last year, having requested a sourdough bread making workshop for his birthday.  He’s been making it ever since and it is divine.</p>\n<p>I lost my casual role as a booking assistant for a holiday letting company three days into the beginning of the domino days of early corona virus.  I didn’t mind really.  We’d already been asked to keep kids home if we could and I have one high schooler with ASD2 and one primary schooler.  How does anyone teach, work, and run a house?</p>\n<p>Clearly people do, but how?</p>\n <p>My isolation began many years ago. I was told that to defeat fear, I had to confront it. So I became a firefighter. </p>\n<p>The Black Summer came, and gave life its new meaning. Our band-of-brothers discovered a newfound purpose and courage in each of us, above the confusion, futility and fear of the fireground. The days and nights were long and sleepless, endured in extreme heat, for months on end &#8211; the threat to life and property chasing us along the coast from the Clarence to the Murray. </p>\n<p>But then, as quickly as it came, it was gone. </p>\n<p>Our chance to pause, to learn, to grieve, to bond and to reflect vanished in the morning, only to envelop us in the bleak pall of isolation. One extreme had dissolved into another. Where the fire had been full-time, work became part-time. We have all the time in the world, where we once had none to spare.</p>\n<p>But where some faltered, we were ready. To us, the confusion, the chaos, and the unceasing struggle of the mind against itself were nothing new. Our families are not foreign to its strain, our souls not strangers to its test. It will not break us. Once more this year, our fears have found us strong. </p>\n <p>Today is bright with a cold wind. It&#8217;s Sunday so we&#8217;ve had a sleep in and late breakfast. Later I&#8217;ll go for a walk and get Batty&#8217;s Burgers for lunch. I rang Mum for Mother&#8217;s Day, she loved the card I made with pop-out flowers. </p>\n<p>That murder of crows seems to have moved on. About a dozen of them came into the area a week or two ago, making that strange call all over the place, upsetting the magpies and minors. The magpies look tiny next to them! Several crows checked out our backyard either from the gum tree or the fence, but didn&#8217;t come down. The last I saw of them was a couple walking along the roof next door, checking over the edge, walk on check some more. It looked very much like they were casing the joint.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m so grateful that we live here for the COVID-19 lockdown rather than in the dark, cold little flat in the middle of the city. Here we have space and light, a backyard, birds. My experience has been relatively serene, I may stay a recluse after this is done.</p>\n <p>Life is bleak.</p>\n<p>A disease that started thousands of kilometres from us that we never thought would affect us is now forcing us to stay home and away from others.</p>\n <p>The colour covid is a purplish colour that we see nightly on our ABC television news.</p>\n<p>The news presenter Jeremy Fernandez wears a tie to match the virus snowballs that drift down the screen behind him. News reader Juanita Phillips, elegant in her navy jacket can also be seen with some big purple covid coloured viral snowballs behind her. I don&#8217;t think I can wear the covid colour; the colour never suited me anyway.</p>\n<p>The government has now progressed us on a three stage recovery plan, and Mother&#8217;s day yesterday was wonderful. We had two family members visit for a bbq.</p>\n<p>Despite the evil virus and being in our seventies we are managing well.</p>\n<p>There is beautiful Australian light in the sky by day and beautiful moon and stars at night. The green plants and the flowers blooming in the garden are pretty and lockdown has not been unpleasant. We can walk to Careel Bay and sit on a sandstone rock and watch the boats bobbing about. We normally swim in the ocean pools but unfortunately this has not been possible so we walk from the Bilbola car park to the ocean pool and just look at it; it will be opened soon in the next stage of recovery process.</p>\n <p>What Isolation Has Taught Me&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>1. Isolation has taught me that we as humans fear. We fear the unknown, the uncontrollable, the elusiveness of existence in a changing world.</p>\n<p>2. Isolation has taught me the importance of acceptance. Accepting the things you cannot change, frees you from the fear of anxiety. It allows you to live in the moment and creates peace of mind. As the age old Serenity Prayer goes &#8220;Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference&#8221;.</p>\n<p>3. Isolation has taught me that we introverts are doing ok. Everyday life may have us adapting and energising and supercharging ourselves to those around us. When left in our natural state, adapting is no longer needed.</p>\n<p>4. Most importantly, isolation has taught me that when stripped away, lacking distraction and constant noise, you better get comfortable with yourself. Because if you don&#8217;t like yourself, accept yourself, enjoy time with yourself, then who else will?</p>\n <p>kindness, friendliness, people in passing taking the time to speak kindly, patience, are all the good things that have emerged in the time of coronavirus. out of anything bad there are good things that come. mine is to be proud to be Australian. thank you to all those people who have shared their positivity with me. I&#8217;m grateful.</p>\n <p>When I came to Australia in 2017 with dream to earn my fortune and to change my 30 years history of misery,misfortune and failure,I was more hopeful than ever before.</p>\n<p>I have been teaching for 25 years but never want to do that. I&#8217;ve been an outsider writer and poet and artist. But I could not decide what I wanted to do in life because I had to think about earning the bread than doing anything fanciful. I have left behind five people waiting for me to come back and change their life in a good way so they can enjoy the amenities of life. They are my parents,my loving wife and two kids,one boy of 12 and a girl of 6 years. I haven&#8217;t seen them for almost 3 years and they are eagerly waiting for me. Last year I lost my mother.</p>\n<p>Since the corona virus pandemic has spread all over the world,my family is worried about me than about themselves. They are at home with all safety in their hands but I go to job every day using public transport like bus,train,taxi and even walking.</p>\n<p>I am working in food industry where almost 200 hundred people work without any social distancing. They use same toilet, same lunch room and work as a team standing side by side sometime touching their shoulders. I must go to job because Australian government only support their citizens not temporary residents like me. But when I GO TO JOB IT FEEL LIKE I M GOING ON A BATTLE FIELD AND MIGHT NOT RETURN BACK. MY FAMILY ALWAYS PRAY THE GOD FOR MY LIFE.</p>\n<p>It is not that you would definitely be killed if you have corona illness ,it is the fear which kills you everyday before corona will kill you one day.</p>\n <p>Lockdown Lament      Day 11 of Lockdown</p>\n<p>For several years now we girls have assembled<br />\nto play table tennis with skill that resembled<br />\nthe moves of young people, so deft and surprising<br />\nwith shots most spectacular while exercising<br />\nto keep ourselves fit and our brains interactive,<br />\nour balance maintained and our bodies attractive.</p>\n<p>Then along came the virus to spoil all our fun<br />\nand keep us apart so there now could be none<br />\nof our  weekly connection and  memory training.<br />\nI’m sure that our love for the game is not waning<br />\nand long for resumption at some time ahead<br />\nwhen we can emerge and corona is dead.</p>\n <p>Life has changed as we know it – forever it seems! We&#8217;ve lost our innocence&#8230;</p>\n<p>The initial fear of COVID19 has morphed into an everyday life pattern for now. What was once scary and new has become the norm! In the beginning I was thirsty for the news and digested every piece of information. A unwilling participant in the craziness that was and is COVID19.</p>\n<p>As the sadness and grief for lives lost and the reality of a changed world sunk in, the battle for normalcy fought with the battle for survival. The shopping and lack of supplies, negotiating safe distances and dealing with work and family became our learning curve in dealing with a new reality. What an experience!</p>\n<p>Isolation laws brought loneliness to be endured. Sadness at not being in close proximity to family; not being able to help out or even visit! The telephone became my new friend. The internet connection became paramount to a happy household. And I’ve never walked so much in my life!</p>\n<p>Bring on the Great Escape from this madness. Someone please ring the bell!</p>\n <p>Overnight everything has changed. Usual day activity became restricted.<br />\nThe COVID-19 highlighted the human vulnerability and changed the values in our lives. Family and health are the most valuable things. :) Having a family dinner, meeting friends for coffee, and enjoying social interaction are the simplest things and best pleasures in life.</p>\n<p>بين عشية وضحاها تغير كل شيء. أصبح نشاط اليوم المعتاد مقيدًا<br />\nسلطت كوفد -١٩<br />\nالضوء على الضعف البشري وغيرت القيم في حياتنا. الأسرة والصحة هما أثمن الأشياء<br />\nإن تناول الطعام مع العائله ، والقهوه مع الأصدقاء ، والاستمتاع بالتفاعل الاجتماعي هي أبسط الأشياء وأفضل الملذات في الحياة</p>\n <p>What is the Matter With …… by Sue<br />\n25/03/20 Day 2 of Lockdown<br />\nWhat is the matter with rain on this earth?<br />\nSometimes too much and then there’s a dearth.<br />\nAlthough that’s our history, things seem to be worse.<br />\nWhat is the matter with rain on this earth?</p>\n<p>What is the matter with fire in our land?<br />\nIt seems to be widespread with flames that are fanned<br />\nBy winds catastrophic, beyond our command<br />\nWhat is the matter with fire in this land?</p>\n<p>What is the matter with us, human kind?<br />\nStruck down by a virus and no one can find<br />\nA cure or a vaccine to ease all our minds<br />\nWhat is the matter with human kind?</p>\n<p>What is the future for this human race?<br />\nCan we stop global warming before it’s too late?<br />\nOr will coal drive recovery to speed up the pace?<br />\nWhat is the future for this human race?</p>\n <p>The Boys broke down the door to my Grans<br />\nEnglish, isolate house, to find her, Staired, stared<br />\nat them, barely breathing, choking on the smallest living<br />\nIlling, Killing Contra thing.

Wow. I can finally pick up by free Beat&#8217;s Headphones that I ordered in early March but couldn&#8217;t pick up because the store closed. It&#8217;s now May 8th.</p>\n<p>I lined up 1.5 metres behind the person in front of me when a Security Guard walked up to me to ask me which direction did I come from? I stretched out my arm to indicate the direction toward David Jones. Oh so I did not enter via the main entrance from the street?</p>\n<p>No I did not enter from the street.<br />\nI was redirected to line up again to get my temperature checked and to also read a big sign that I had not been in contact with anyone with Covid 19, I did not have a cough, I did not feel unwell. Once I read the sign and said &#8220;no&#8221; to each question, I could proceed to have my temperature checked with an electronic beep. I was deemed &#8220;OK&#8221; and could proceed to go back into one of the two lines to enter the store.</p>\n<p>I did not enter the store. I had to stay outside, showed my ID and the Apple assistant called someone to get my order. Every staff member had a face mask on. The security guards were dressed in black.</p>\n<p>It is the new normal. It is like a Sci Fi movie, robotic, distant, clinical. I am living in this but it is not a movie. It is real.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;ve been in lockdown for six weeks now, seems like a lot longer though. There hasn&#8217;t been much to do, the shelves at the shops are empty, for some reason people are buying excessive amounts of toilet paper, strange I know.</p>\n<p>It seems like the world is going to end, the Australian government has already given out 3 stimulus packages, the three of them combined are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, pretty crazy.</p>\n<p>Millions of Australians are losing their jobs, everything is bad. I can&#8217;t see my friends and family anymore, I can&#8217;t go to the movies, the park, I can&#8217;t even sit down once I&#8217;m outside of my house.</p>\n<p>Luckily the other day my household got their hands on an eight pack of toilet paper, seems like toilet paper is worth more than diamonds now. In my house, we are running pretty low on canned food, luckily the restrictions eased this week so it should be easier to get food.</p>\n<p>Online school is not as hard as it had sounded, you just get work set to you, have an online meeting and then do your work, not so hard. I have been getting my work done a lot faster than at normal school though, I just fly through it at light speed.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m about to start going back to school once a week on a Tuesday now as restrictions ease because we seem to have flattened the curve, I don&#8217;t know why but I have a feeling the curve is going to go straight back up after we start easing restrictions, that&#8217;s all I have to say about this pandemic, see you later!</p>\n <p>The first three weeks of this were great. Plenty of time to write and think about my place in the world, now that social obligations seem to have had disappeared. So much more reading. So much more time to exercise.</p>\n<p>But now something else is taking over. Weeks of the same house, the same weekend. Over and over. Now I’m feeling a bit like I’m ready for this to end. I&#8217;m feeling tired. The motivation I’ve known is falling away, and small things are beginning to feel difficult. I don’t have the outside world giving me energy, keeping me active. It’s all self driven.</p>\n<p>I’m ready to go out to a concert. I’m ready to go to a party and talk to someone new. Someone I haven’t seen for months! Someone new! A beer in the pub. Going to the footy and feeling the energy of thousands of people all excited and engaged.</p>\n<p>Winter is going to be hard if the restrictions stay. Leaving the house will be less enticing, and exercise will be more difficult. At least until now I’ve had a nice autumn day to go out and have a walk in.</p>\n<p>So I’m ready to go back to the way it was. I’ve learnt a lot about myself. And I’ve learnt the outside world is a source of energy for even the most introverted of us.</p>\n <p>I am a psychotherapist, preferring talking and active therapy to drugs (unless absolutely necessary).</p>\n<p>The &#8216;stay home&#8217; period has opened up much more online activity for therapy. I have patients as far as Gosford, who would normally catch a train, a bus and then walk to get to me, then reverse to go home.</p>\n<p>These days we use FaceTime/Skype/Zoom, and these are almost as good as face-to-face sessions.</p>\n<p>It could become the norm for uptimes to 80% of all sessions.<br />\nThe COVID-19 shutdown has forced new communications means, and I, for one, am very happy about this.</p>\n <p>Rain<br />\n03/04/20 Day 12 of Lockdown</p>\n<p>Pitter patter, pitter patter<br />\nOn the window pane<br />\nPitter patter, what’s the matter?<br />\nNothing, it’s just rain.<br />\nPitter patter, will it splatter<br />\nWhere we need it most?<br />\nPitter patter, let it scatter<br />\nInland from the coast.<br />\nPitter patter let it shatter<br />\nDrought seen not before<br />\nPitter patter, pitter patter<br />\nFill dams and rivers more.</p>\n <p>Bloated and bruised.<br />\nUncomfortable and sore.<br />\nHeat pack, paracetamol, chocolate, and audiobooks.</p>\n<p>Another five days of being reminded of my body&#8217;s sex and biological imperative.</p>\n <p>March 26</p>\n<p>A friend of mine told me, about a little bug,<br />\nI figured they meant, one that hides under my rug.<br />\nSo imagine my surprise, when I heard on the news,<br />\nIt’s invisible to all, and just ignores your views.</p>\n<p>When Donald T blathered, Get out of USA! Or I’ll squash you with my heels.<br />\nThe little bugger answered, I don’t do deals.</p>\n<p>It dances in the air and gets snug in your lung,<br />\nIf you don’t get it out, it’ll make you feel quite bung.<br />\nIt’ll block up your nose and irritate your lips,<br />\nYou really won’t believe what is does to cruise ships.</p>\n<p>So cafes are out and you can’t front up to the pub,<br />\nCos it’s on every surface, and therein lies the rub.<br />\nYou have a seat, enjoy a drink, wave goodbye and leave<br />\nOnly to find out later, its infected your sleeve.</p>\n<p>Then you’ll have the splutters and be stuck in home detention,<br />\nYour family has to shop for you, and oh, I forgot to mention &#8211;<br />\nDon’t treat it lightly, especially if you’re short of breath,<br />\nBecause that little bug is an omen of death.</p>\n<p>March 26</p>\n<p>Mary had a little lapseofjudgment</p>\n<p>Mary had a little lamb, She took it to the market.<br />\nThe place was overcrowded, She had nowhere to park’it.<br />\nIt mingled with strange creatures, from so far and wide,<br />\nIt started feeling funny, you know, on the inside.</p>\n<p>The lamb baa’d, baa’d and baa’d, hoping Mary would come and get‘er<br />\nThen she’d be cared for and would soon be feeling better.<br />\nBut Mary never came, as creatures around started falling,<br />\nThe lamb imagined… I can hear someone calling.<br />\nYes, the big ram in the sky, with pointing finger said:<br />\nYou, and you, and you, it’s your turn to be dead.</p>\n <p>The first time I ever heard the word &#8220;pandemic&#8221; was in Year 6, drowned out by a chorus of chitter-chatter in the classroom. Today, I see that word daily &#8211; whether it be on the news or on in my YouTube recommended. Awkward conversations seem to always bring up &#8220;coronavirus&#8221; and be prepared to be flooded with a thousand &#8220;you got the corona!&#8221; if you dare cough without muting yourself. In truth, I think that COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in our minds just as much as it has in bodies.</p>\n<p>Like many others, I check the statistics daily. And every day I have to remind myself that these small black and white numbers on my laptop screen are more than pixels. They are lives. Humans with friends, families, passions and hopes and dreams. I simply cannot comprehend why people would choose to disregard this in return for what? Temporary superficial satisfaction?</p>\n<p>And not to mention the revealed faces of racism. A 15 year old high school student should never be subjected to xenophobic and racist remarks every day. But we are. A woman shouting &#8220;fucking Asians&#8221; in my face as I walk home from school should never happen. Belittling and stereotyping should never happen either yet it is relentless in my life.</p>\n<p>I am lucky to live here, where I do not have to fear the virus for much longer. Nonetheless, it is impossible to escape what has already settled in some people&#8217;s minds.</p>\n<p>It just takes my breath away.</p>\n <p>Well it&#8217;s a beautiful day! Gloriously warm and sunny and the sky is clear. It feels busier -more cars appearing and roaring up and down our streets.</p>\n<p>We moved just before the lockdown. We were in our glorious family home for 25 happy years &#8211; but it was time for a change. So we just made it! In the nick of time! Now we are in the middle of a still bustling Potts Point with new faces and new walks &#8211; and with each other constantly! From large house to apartment living &#8211; an adjustment at the best of times &#8211; but eerily different in these circumstances. But we are happy.</p>\n<p>Covid-19 and the need to be locked down has been both liberating and confronting. Liberating because we have permission to just &#8216;be&#8217; &#8211; not having to physically be somewhere else &#8211; and permission to go under the radar and be anonymous.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the coin however, is the very fact of being with oneself &#8211; and challenging dark thoughts I can otherwise physically escape from. It can be like sitting in the middle of a mess &#8211; just sitting with and amongst it. And some days are better than others.</p>\n<p>But aren&#8217;t we blessed! A close-knit family making change and living in the safest of surroundings when we compare ourselves with other parts of the world. Truly an island. Perhaps that&#8217;s what lockdown feels like &#8211; a lot of individual islands.</p>\n<p>Today, Saturday is great. Our beautiful daughters and baby granddaughter are visiting &#8211; and it is absolute joy! I had no idea being a grandmother could extend my excitement and love as much as it does! And feel like a child again myself &#8211; a naughty one!<br />\nMore to come.</p>\n<p>Enough for today.</p>\n<p>Bronny Carroll</p>\n <p>Living through a pandemic is new, yet strangely familiar. In Tanzania, East Africa, where we lived for 12 years, cholera epidemics appeared at times in our village. The market would be closed down with restrictions on wedding and funeral feasts. We worked closely with people living with HIV, a pandemic much less contagious, slower to harm, and yet dangerous too for health workers.</p>\n<p>My translation work has been far busier than usual, with urgent deadlines for Swahili factsheets on COVID-19, and then revisions as public information keeps changing. Working out how to translate sanitiser, social distancing and masks was a challenge.</p>\n<p>I’ve had two uncomfortable tests for the virus. Both were negative. The first within a week of returning from Indonesia with a rhinovirus, according to the results. The second because of a lingering cough. With the recent slight ease in restrictions, I am glad I can now visit my 93-year-old father in his aged care facility and have our son and his girlfriend over for dinner.</p>\n<p>I’d hoped to have more time to do art, but I know the translation work is important as there are very few Swahili translators in Australia. I’ve managed to do collage pieces, some as challenges through The Other Art Show, and a large Self-portrait in the Age of COVID-19 to submit for an online Instagram exhibition with Lane Cove Gallery. I’m enjoying doing an online poetry course with Coursera, and facilitate two regular zoom meetings: a local writing group and a group working on developing our creativity using the book, The Artist’s Way.</p>\n<p>I’ve planted garlic, spring onion, mint, carrots and lemon grass in our back yard, mainly using food from the supermarket rather than seeds or seedlings. I think I wanted to affirm life at this time.</p>\n <p>Living Online</p>\n<p>How I hate it!<br />\nIsolated<br />\nNot that it is different from any other time<br />\nA hermit anyway.</p>\n<p>Computer and phone my new best friends<br />\nMy paintings have lost their punch<br />\nWords on paper don’t count for much<br />\nNow and then I buck the trend<br />\nEscape for an hour or two<br />\nSomewhere I’ve never been<br />\nA new street, a forest, or just somewhere green</p>\n<p>Friends<br />\nand family complain<br />\nIsolated<br />\nGet out and breathe<br />\nMake some plans<br />\nDream</p>\n<p>Soon we will be free<br />\nInstead, I fall hopelessly in love<br />\nWith my computer screen.</p>\n <p>newspaper, email, radio, TV , everywhere&#8230;.<br />\nCovid19 in Wuhan, in China and on the move<br />\nvia touch, by hand, by car, by train, by plane<br />\nfrom there and here from over there from over here<br />\nHead spinning &#8230;</p>\n<p>better to turn off the TV, the internet and wait.<br />\nWould it be as Wuhan, or London, or Italy or New York or Spain<br />\nI read, I organised, I agonised, I mobilised, I zoomed once, twice , thrice and times beyond recall</p>\n<p>I trained, I donned, I doffed, I zoomed and zoomed again.<br />\nI tested, tested and tested<br />\nI distanced so my friends were distant<br />\nI waited and watched and washed my hands<br />\nand sprayed the phone, the desk, the mouse, the tap, the door handle and washed my hands again, changed my clothes and shoes<br />\n&#8230; and waited</p>\n <p>My thoughts are about the positive things that have emerged from this time, and for me they are the little things. There are days when everything is quiet and still in my neighbourhood where noise is always present. I can stand in my back garden and hear the camellia petals fall. I can walk onto busy Forest Road at 8 am and there isn’t a car in sight. I can lie in bed at night and hear &#8230;silence where normally it is the roar of a plane overhead. For me this is bliss.</p>\n<p>It seems as though we have been given permission to do what is healthy and good &#8211; slow right down. Find a comfy seat and become absorbed in stitching, or reading, or day dreaming.</p>\n<p>It has been a joy to watch the surge in creativity and sharing of music or words online. Singing from balconies, dancing in the streets, online festivals and short videos. There is so much to see that time can hardly contain it all. These are now a part of my life which did not exist before.</p>\n<p>Human connection still abounds and fills the heart. We all check on each other more. Quiz night via Zoom, text messages to elderly parents once a day, Facebook messages to friends and family overseas. The only thing missing is a hug.</p>\n<p>Finally nature which never lets us down. Reclaiming quiet streets and cleaner canals. Blooming, thriving, soothing our soul. All these things I hope will last long after the pandemic has left our world.</p>\n <p>This week, I suddenly told a workmate that I miss seeing him put eardrops in his ears. He’s tall and he has the longest arms. He had an ear infection before we left the physical workspace. I presume it’s better now. I hope so.</p>\n<p>In any other context that would be a weird thing to say, but everything is weird right now.</p>\n<p>I was talking to another workmate online and I couldn’t figure out if he were crying, because the connection was bad and he was all pixelated. I didn’t have the guts to ask if he were alright. I wish I had.</p>\n<p>A third workmate told me he had four books, and a videogame, lying unfinished around the house and that made me really sad. I miss work. And I miss seeing my workmates smile.</p>\n<p>Especially because the threat to our work is real in a way that may also not eventuate. Who knows?</p>\n<p>It’s worth staying home, though. Saving lives is the most important thing to do right now.</p>\n <p>My baby will be 6 months old tomorrow. 6 months that have changed our lives. 6 months in which the world that we thought we were bringing her in to has changed irrevocably.</p>\n<p>When she was a newborn, I would watch the news and see our nation devoured by bushfires. The air in Sydney became unsafe for her tiny lungs and people on the street started wearing masks. It felt new, this fear of the invisible, of micro particles in the air that could cause so much damage. The smoke finally did dissipate, the fires were put out, but the masks remained. A new threat, once again invisible, but this time a virus. I began to feel nervous of every friendly interaction, scared of every passerby who would stop to peer into the pram at the little girl who was growing chubbier each week.</p>\n<p>One day over the clatter of a busy cafe I was complaining to a friend about having to cancel our overseas trip &#8211; the one we were taking our daughter to meet her grandparents. The next day, things began to lock down.<br />\nMy husband brought home his computer from work and set up in our bedroom.</p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks we have been encased in our own little family cocoon. And in that space, our little girl has thrived. From rolling around the living room floor, to trying her first foods &#8211; banana (a winner) and peas (definitely not). These are the images of lockdown that I will remember. While the threat of being made redundant looms in the background and video calls can&#8217;t make up for the lost hugs from grandparents, watching our baby grow has turned a time of anguish and uncertainty into one of discovery and of hope.</p>\n <p>I got on my bicycle today and rode along the river. There was red and white tape to keep people off the grass along the edges of the water near the train station but a few people had crossed over it. Some adolescents sitting shoulder to shoulder. Probably smoking pot. I didn&#8217;t look. </p>\n<p>Further up the river there were people lying in swimming costumes in the long grass. I had not been out on my bike for about five weeks, partly because of all the pollen and my hayfever, and partly because it gets stressful having joggers and cyclists panting and puffing &amp;; you don&#8217;t know what the particles in the slip-stream are doing and if something will land on yr lips or in yr eye.</p>\n<p>Last time I went out I had leather ski gloves on and a balaclava and warm jackets, and now I&#8217;m in a T-shirt and shorts. They never said we could not go out and exercise here, or walk. I did plenty of walking. But even that got stressful sometimes in popular forests of a weekend. </p>\n<p>I missed my trip home to Sydney this spring, and am rescheduled to fly end of November, stay for Xmas. Could even re-book my hotels in Singapore stop-over, no extra cost. But who knows if the planes will be flying or if Singapore Airport will be open. I just have to make sure I stay alive. </p>\n<p>I want to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge again across the glittering coloured water as the ferry leaves Circular Quay. It&#8217;s not a question of five bells, it&#8217;s a question of coming to life again.</p>\n <p>My connections. My connections are here in Sydney but also in New York, Guernsey, France, London, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Hanoi, Tokyo, Toronto.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the latest news? New York- my aunt Julia died from Covid 19 related pneumonia two Sunday&#8217;s ago. She was 84 and was in a nursing home in New Jersey where a worker tested positive five weeks ago. </p>\n<p>London- my friend is not going to open my parcel sent from Sydney in case it has Covid 19 on it. She is leaving it in the glasshouse in her garden for a couple of days. My parcel took a whole month to get there. Usually it takes 10 days.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong- my brother&#8217;s kids still have not gone back to school. They had Christmas holidays and now it&#8217;s the 8th May. They are at 9 and 11 years old. </p>\n<p>Guernsey- my friend is in lockdown. She&#8217;s not working as a casual teacher as schools have closed. Doesn&#8217;t know when she will get work again.</p>\n<p>France- my elderly friend said there&#8217;s a &#8220;Chinese virus&#8221; going around. Maybe the news is American? </p>\n<p>China- no news. It seems all is fine. My dad hasn&#8217;t said anything about the relatives, so they must be fine.</p>\n<p>Singapore &#8211; well my friend said she is working from home.</p>\n<p>Hanoi- restrictions are being lifted, the lockdown is over but my friend has been advised to keep social distancing.</p>\n<p>Tokyo- my friend and her family are all fine. Her girls play with the neighbours kids.</p>\n<p>Toronto- my aunt has shared videos with me so I can learn to cook authentic Chinese food from Hong Kong videos. </p>\n<p>Well this weekend I will see my sister, my connection in Sydney. </p>\n <p>Well it&#8217;s been another week of remote teaching using Zoom to see the kids at school.</p>\n<p>This week I did two cooking lessons, one with Year 9 and the other one with the Year 10 boys. Both classes made a pasta dish. The boys love cooking and it is amazing to see how organised they are in their own kitchens at home. On the Zoom screen they can see each other as well and the students who finish early can eat and watch the show.</p>\n<p>This week I have been also inspired to cook. I have learnt how to cook in the last few weeks ham and pea soup for my dad who tasted it at my school&#8217;s Open Day last year. I wanted to make something nice for him to eat. I had never bought a ham hock before in my life, however, the recipe called for one and I just bought one from the butcher shop. The slow cooker works wonders. It cooks overnight and the smell of soup wafting through the morning while I waken, is life again. It beckons to say &#8220;eat me&#8221; but not in the Alice in Wonderland story where some strange things happen. No, the soup is a testament to being alive and being able to carry on and help another person appreciate being alive with memories of a time past where you could go and buy soup in a crowd of people.</p>\n<p>Yes, this week I have been inspired to cook and I made Jamie Oliver&#8217;s ratatouille rustic style with aubergines and courgettes but we call them egg plant and zucchini.  I&#8217;ve also made Luke Nyguen&#8217;s auntie&#8217;s steamed fish recipe for Lunar New Year. Fish he said is a symbol of wealth. I am fortunate to be a teacher in the pandemic.</p>\n <p>I am amazed at how quickly our freedoms were curbed and in just a blink of an eye, we were all just told to stop. We were running a marathon, and in the middle of the race, we were told to just stop. Many did stop. But most kept jogging, and then walking.</p>\n<p>We paused. Took a breath. And it hurt. It hurt our legs, our arms, our body, our ego. We could have died. Some did. But most of us did not. So we kept breathing — the panting turning into calmer breaths. </p>\n<p>And then we rested. But some did not — the frontliners, the “essential” workers, the heroes. Our own breaths kept us going, most of us, in the safety of our homes. But for others, there is no home to rest safely.</p>\n<p>Life just goes on. </p>\n<p>Simple thoughts cross my mind too. Did the birds wonder why there weren’t crowds on the beach? Did the whales and dolphins realise that the cruise ships stopped moving? Did we even bother to notice the changes around us that did not include humans? I feel very lucky to still have the freedom to have my own thoughts.</p>\n<p>It is amazing how this phenomenon has given us an opportunity to discover which freedoms are most valuable for us. </p>\n<p>What could be yours?</p>\n <p>Today is VE Day. Scott Morrison spoke today, about the three stages of lifting restrictions that have been in place, for many weeks. I have friends in Cambridgeshire, England, who have been in lockdown for 12 weeks and have been told this might extend, until Christmas. I have friends in Cheshire, England, who have lost their mother. She died in her own home, after a fall that was not COVID-19 related. They cannot see her and she will be buried in a hospital gown, rather than the favourite dress she had specified. They cannot have the funeral service they would want for her. </p>\n<p>Locally, in Umina Beach on the NSW Central Coast, I have another friend, whose mother died, in her nursing home, also not COVID-19 related. Again, there was no funeral service &#8211; the body was cremated and the ashes were delivered to my friend’s workplace. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what about me? My husband and I operate a small business &#8211; Peninsular Office Supplies. Considered an essential service, supplying the necessary goods to both businesses and home workers, we have remained open, throughout the lockdown. My husband is committed to his business and his customers. Closing was not an option, not only because he’s devoted to his customers, but also because we really need an income.  We have staff that need to keep their jobs and for whom we feel deeply responsible. </p>\n<p>However, the overall affect on me has been minimal. Apart from the social distancing, not much has changed for me. I go to work, sometimes. If it’s quiet, the boss tells me to stay at home, which suits me fine. I continue to make regular deliveries to customers, then shop as usual. I feel blessed, in this strange time, to be able to live my life, almost normally. </p>\n <p>A long planned career break coincided with the most extraordinary events I can ever recall in my fifty seven years as a Sydney-sider.</p>\n<p>The break took on a special dimension when, by good luck, I landed a job as a driver and guide taking small groups of overseas visitors to the Blue Mountains.</p>\n<p>The role was at times challenging but also the perfect relief from nine-to-five office work.</p>\n<p>The clients were nearly always happy and excited to be in Australia, their feedback was immediate. Better still, I was living the dream of an outside job in the fresh air.</p>\n<p>I started in October 2019 as the business prepared for a very busy summer. The day trip to the Mountains was its most popular tour. </p>\n<p>But by March 2020 nearly everything in my commentary was turned upside down.</p>\n<p>“Dear guests, many parts of Sydney, including the lovely forested mountains and valleys we visit today are very vulnerable to wildfire.” I just loved explaining fire and its role in the bush.</p>\n<p>“In the ten years since the concept of Catastrophic had been introduced as a danger rating, there has not been cause to use it”, I would declare.</p>\n<p>And then the fires came &#8211;  hideous, ferocious and yes, catastrophic.</p>\n<p>Driving through Bell after the fires, I simply gave up talking to the guests and let them look in silent disbelief and the near totally scorched earth that remained.</p>\n<p>The vehicle would slow, the cabin would grow quiet. Eva Cassidy’s Fields of Gold would lilt from the sound system in a mournful ode. </p>\n<p>Not long into February, the pandemic was looming. The coach parking bays at Bondi Beach, usually busting with buses, were now mostly empty.</p>\n<p>My career break is now over.</p>\n <p>Today ended up better than I expected. I took my sister to the doctor&#8217;s yesterday so she is back in quarantine in her nursing home for another 14 days so I thought I should tell her kids that she was well and thought the home was doing a good job keeping her safe even though I was tired and didn&#8217;t really want to bother. I was sure they would be worried, with what&#8217;s going on at Newmarch House and it can be difficult to get her because mobile phone reception and internet connection is so bad there. Fancy building a nursing home with such crummy connections these days! Most 70 year-olds I know have mobile phones, tablets, iPads and PCs, and just about everything we have to do is online these days. Anyway, when I logged on this morning, there was a lovely email from Jodi so I am glad I made the effort. My students were also quiet this morning even with an assessment due,  so checking on them didn&#8217;t take long &#8211; another plus for the day. </p>\n<p>Peter&#8217;s leg still looks pretty awful so we had to fit in another trip to the doctor as well as shopping and my exercise class (I HATE Zoom &#8211; even with my camera off).  The doctor was happy so that was good news too. We were late getting to the supermarket though and all two (!) disabled spots were gone. I could have done without having to juggle my chair and shopping &#8211; just makes everything more painful. Still, I got Peter into the garden late afternoon &#8211; it was too lovely a day to spend indoors on the computer. Cheered us both up. </p>\n<p>Will see our boys this weekend too. Lots to celebrate tonight.</p>\n<p>Cheers! </p>\n <p>Another day closer to when everything might go back to a semblance of &#8216;normal.&#8217; The city has been a little more populated, the buses departing from the stands at QVB in this peak hour are carrying a handful of passengers instead of none at all. It&#8217;s been interesting seeing public transport carry on as if nothing has happened&#8230;</p>\n<p>People ringing the bookshop have more of an expectation that we will be open. As the restrictions lighten, it seems that some of the public think that everything is back to normal, that all the shops will be open for personal shoppers. We have managed to stay afloat with web and phone orders and skeleton staff, and it&#8217;s actually been quite refreshing in a way not to have customers in the store, but we will be trialling opening to the public from next week. Asking them nicely, of course, to keep 1.5 metres apart, not come in if they feel unwell, and to sanitise their hands, please. Getting rather tired of the smell and feel of hand sanitiser liquid (and despite being told not to, it is rather interesting how many times you do touch your face and rub your eyes &#8211; not recommended when your hands are anointed by alcohol cleansers!) </p>\n<p>Times were tough before Covid19 and they probably won&#8217;t be that much better once shops are open again, but the bookshop is in a better position than the cafes, bars, restaurants that once fed and watered the crowds. The people might come back, but the worry is, will those services? How have they paid rent and utility bills on spaces that haven&#8217;t earnt any money? Will they have the funds to start up all over again? Everything won&#8217;t be back to normal. We just hope it might be.</p>\n <p>My husband and I lead a bushwalking group for retired people and were determined to keep fit enough to continue so we have walked EVERY day for the last 7 weeks. We initially walked the Cherry Tree Path 3.3km return in BOWRAL but when that got too busy to be sure of Social Distancing we&#8217;ve returned to the bush tracks in the Mount Alexandra Recreational Area and walked parts of the Box Vale Track to the Welby Weir and the 40 foot falls,as well as the 60 foot falls track over the Natai River behind Mt Alexandra. We&#8217;ve loved the bird life at the CecilHoskins Reserve as well as the Welby Dam.</p>\n<p>When it’s been wet and windy we&#8217;ve just donned our coats and walked around the town on footpaths. </p>\n<p>I started this adventure with a sore knee and back and a friend gave me her old exercise bike which I have ridden for 20 minutes everyday which has been beneficial.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;ve missed, we swam 4 times a week for 30 minutes before this began and today we drove to the sea and what joy to swim again in the Woonona Sea Pool a little cool though.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed learning to use zoom to enjoy our weekly church service and Connect Groups. We&#8217;ve also used it for U3A history lectures and Meditation. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve rearranged every cupboard in the house and built an extra store cupboard which I&#8217;ve laid out with air tight labeled boxes.</p>\n<p>I love to cook so I&#8217;ve cooked lots of new recipes from the newspaper and supermarket magazines. Pear and Blue Cheese Tart and Marmalade Bread and Butter pudding have been my husband&#8217;s favorites. </p>\n<p>I almost feel guilty to say looking back I have enjoyed this time.</p>\n<p>With few commitments and my husband of 40 for company.</p>\n <p>My wife and I are both retired and live at Dolans Bay. We spend quite an amount of time mucking about in boats along the Hacking River. Weekends were always too busy on the boat ramps and river so we always went out only during the week days. Plenty of parking and the waterways were quite. Since the lock down and extended school holidays there has been a great change. The number of boats out and about in Port Hacking during the week has increased on average about ten fold. People are so restricted with regard where they can go and what they can do many have realised how good and how safe weekday boating is. What a change.   </p>\n <p>Part one.</p>\n<p>He’s home.  He’s home all the time. He is WFH afterall. They wake up early.  I hear them from bed, talking loudly; even louder than my 8 min meditation on the Insight timer app. Sleeping in is impossible in our shoebox apartment.  I was hoping we won’t be in lockdown in this place, but when lockdown was announced in mid March we had no other choice. </p>\n<p>I get up slowly.  I feel my body and I start to unravel my fancy yoga mat I got for my birthday.  Despite all the free Zoom exercise videos, Facebook LIVE and Instagram LIVE exercise programs the net is overflowing with, I open up my Lola Berry ‘The Happy Life’ book with its photos of sun salutations, camel pose, wheel pose, butterfly pose and a pilate exercise from my mind.</p>\n<p>I am feeling strong on this day.  Depending on my daughter’s mood, she would either join me, interrupt me or better yet leave me alone to fulfil this ritual.</p>\n<p>From mid March 2020 till about early May 2020 (close to two months) we have been in this lockdown which has ultimately lead to a flattening of the curve.  The fear of getting COVID-19 was very real and in the first few weeks upon waking in the morning I would try to remind myself that I am not in fact in a nightmare but this is real life.  Forced isolation, no freedom, no planning for the future, dreams on hold and as of 8 May, no job.  I was laid off the day before Easter Friday.  I felt shattered as it gave me purpose and also had colleagues I loved working with.  I thought since they had allowed me to WFH and I was in their Zoom calls, I was valued and essential.</p>\n<p>To be continued&#8230;</p>\n <p>I am a 70 years+ male from the Southern Highlands, south of Sydney, and have only been resident in this area for 4 years.  After settling in, I ventured into the Bowral Men’s Shed one day and have been a member ever since.</p>\n<p>Bowral Mens’ Shed like all Men’s Sheds is a concept to assist with mental health by bringing men together (and now some women) most with similar views, handy with their hands and eager to learn new tasks; but it’s the involvement with others that makes it most enjoyable. Our Shed has a woodworking area, a separate metal area and another covering all things electrical. </p>\n<p>When social distancing came about due to Covid–19, the lunchroom tables and chairs were rearranged to enable separation of members by the required 1.5m. There is friendly rivalry between the metal workers and woodworkers. During the first morning tea under the distancing rules, one of the metal workers came with a measuring tape for a bit of fun and proceeded around the table measuring the distance between all members and then in some cases, move them a few centimetres. One of the woodworkers on seeing this said he was amazed that metal workers knew what to do with a measuring tape. The same gentleman some time back noticed me struggling with a piece of wood and asked what I did previously for a living. On telling him he replied “Oh I could see you weren’t a carpenter”! </p>\n<p>The Mens’ Shed unfortunately has closed down due to the restrictions at the moment and I miss the varied conversations, humour and comradeship from such a great bunch of old fogies like me.  </p>\n<p>Hopefully when we get back together, all will still be with us and we can all remember the last joke we heard. </p>\n <p>All my friends talk about the fat side effect of Covid 19 but up till now I seem to have avoided the big (literally) problem.  Sure my day was a chronicle of tea, tea, zoom coffee, tea, coffee, sherry and an evening glass of wine &#8211; what else was there to do to mark the day&#8217;s progress after 6 weeks in voluntary lock down.  So, after the first reduction in lock down restrictions, why was I suddenly craving double servings of most foods?  Comfort eating or a delayed anxiety eating symptom?  Maybe the anxiety due to the pandemic was the cause of a loss of weight in my case so perhaps this was a rebound.</p>\n<p>My other theory is boredom &#8211; I have now mastered turban tying to indulge a fantasy and cover my overlong hair;  I have had so many zoom chats and read so many books that my eyes are tired;  every leaf in my garden is in place and most cupboards and shelves have been cleaned.  I even washed the door-stops!  </p>\n<p>Hmmm, boredom eating does sound like a corona lock down side effect and I think it will probably affect the whole global population except for essential workers, of course. I hope we have enough Diabetes 2 test kits.</p>\n <p>As I sit here thinking about what I am going to write, despite all of the devastating negative impacts COVID-19 has made in some people&#8217;s lives, lots of positive thoughts come to my mind from this pandemic. </p>\n<p>This is because being locked up for the past month has felt more like a holiday than a global pandemic. Although it can get boring being locked in my home all of the time, I have realised how nice it has been to spend time with my family, try new things and to just relax.</p>\n<p>When COVID-19 first started I was very worried about what was going to happen because my mum is a front-line health care worker and could potentially be with people that have Coronavirus. This terrified me because I didn’t know what was going to happen. </p>\n<p>It is so good to see the support, love and kindness everyone is showing through these tough times, and it shows how much we can accomplish by working together. Think about this time as an opportunity to help others and to reflect on how we can make this world a better place. Because who knows what&#8217;s going to happen next.</p>\n <p>I read something the other day that mentioned that other than fight-or-flight, our bodies have one more trick up their sleeve for stressful situations: play dead.</p>\n<p>That was my default after being stood down from my job because of the pandemic. I had no motivation to get anything done; I was lost and existing in a haze of Netflix-Instagram-Stan-Twitter-repeat.</p>\n<p>Giving myself time to just exist, though, turned out to be exactly what I needed. </p>\n<p>Instead of beating myself up for not getting that six-pack, starting a side-hustle, spring-cleaning my home or changing the world, I took stock of what I have and where I want to be after all this.</p>\n<p>I pulled out old books that gave me new perspectives, found a new love for my studies, walked the dog in the sunshine in the middle of the day, started making French press coffee instead of instant, started practising pilates, bought myself a new journal, and finally started working with my body clock instead of against it. I’m embracing the fact that I’m not a morning person now, giving myself time to drink my coffee slowly and read. I start my uni work later in the day, ramping up in the afternoon. I stay up later, reading, journaling, watching shows that make me think and feel things. I spend quality time with my brother and my partner, cook dinner and clean up before bed, ready to start the next day organised and fresh.</p>\n<p>I know the world is upside down and I can’t imagine how hard it is for some people right now. I&#8217;m lucky, in so many ways, but especially at the moment, because I can&#8217;t help but think that this whole thing has been a much-needed reset for me.</p>\n <p>En castellano o español es más fácil escribir como ha cambiado la vida en estas ultimas semanas, eternamente esperando noticias diarias de mi madre, tan lejos, en otro continente y nosotros sin poder viajar.<br />\nLa tristeza diaria en la espera de buenas noticias, que mi mami amaneció sin fiebre, que si está bien como ayer. Quizás es uno de esos pacientes que no presentan síntomas.</p>\n<p>Mis maletas ya preparadas y las de mi hermana también. Quizás podamos viajar en Julio, pero que tal si la frontera de nuestro país permanece cerrada. Quizás podamos viajar cerca de la navidad.<br />\nYo se que tarde o temprano mi mami se nos ira para siempre, como dicen es la ley de la vida, para entonces estaremos con ella hasta que se la apague la velita como decimos nosotros.</p>\n<p>La vida continua sin detenerse, el sol sale en la mañana como si nada ha ocurrido y continuara por milenios con la misma rutina, pero nosotros pequeños insignificantes ya no estaremos aquí.<br />\nBueno como dicen los latinos al mal tiempo buena cara y así ha cambiado mi rutina y hasta me encuentro en mejor estado físico por ya no voy a la oficina, salgo en la mañana con mi perro Guau, somos afortunados porque ya no vivimos en la ciudad, estamos cerca de los parques y pequeños riachuelos.<br />\nHe notado como las aves Ibis se ven limpias and pacíficas, no hay basura para comer así es que han decidido como yo comer mas saludable. </p>\n<p>Saludable en lenguaje Ibis es más gusanitos del estero y en el proceso de extracción de gusanitos oxigenan la tierra.</p>\n<p>Mi jardín se ve lindo, pero mi corazón se derrite lentamente como la cera de las velas. Yo creo que necesito un café  con varias cucharadas de azúcar.</p>\n <p>Covid 19 is a new born virus that the world has never seen before. We do not know much about this virus but scientists are trying to make an immunisation. We do know that it came from China. The news said that maybe it came from a wet market. I went to a wet market in Malaysia last year. The floor was wet and it was hot and full of flies. There was meat lying out in the open air. There were cages full of live chickens and dead chickens on top of the cages and a bucket of chicken guts next to it. Everything looked contaminated. Scientists think that the virus came from a bat but I did not see any bats there. Maybe they had sold out. It was very interesting but personally I&#8217;d prefer Coles.</p>\n<p>Covid 19 has affected my daily life. Things I can&#8217;t do right now-I can&#8217;t see my friends. I can&#8217;t play on the play grounds. I can&#8217;t go to the shops to buy new toys. I can&#8217;t go to parties. I can&#8217;t go to<br />\nthe meetings. I am also worried about my Great Grandma because she is over 80.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s look at the positives!<br />\nLess pollution.<br />\nRare turtles are building nests on empty Thai beaches.<br />\nThe water is clearer.<br />\nThe air is cleaner.<br />\nPeople have stopped driving so much. </p>\n <p>I am a university lecturer and I have been working at home during the #COVID19AU lockdown. I am very lucky because I have a stable job and I do not have to worry about job security (at least for now). But I am also under enormous pressure. The university told us this is a wonderful time for researchers to be productive and publish prolifically. It is also a wonderful time to become an online teaching guru. It is essential for us to understand that our students are very anxious. My department head just shows off the jogging, the baking, the &#8216;creative&#8217; craft, and wonderful bonding time with family.  </p>\n<p>But no one cares that the university academic staff are unbelievably stressed and anxious. I am really sick of that pretended positivity and the assumed superhuman qualities. I have been working 14 hours every day over the last four weeks because I have to keep up with online teaching (and responding to endless student complaint-emails about how they are anxious), publishing, researching, and grant proposal submission. I am exhausted but I am not even allowed to say that &#8211; because only my students are entitled to anxiety. If I am anxious and exhausted, maybe I am not good enough for the job. And as a migrant, I have been constantly told that I should be feeling so entitled. I am constantly being told that another Australian could use my job even though I am more qualified.  I hope the semester is going to be over soon because I really just want a 14-hour sleep. </p>\n <p>TOTALLY OVER COVID</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m totally over Covid!&#8221;<br />\nSaid the pretty girl into her phone.<br />\nI came home and told my beloved,<br />\nWho said, &#8220;She isn&#8217;t alone.&#8221;<br />\nAt the risk of becoming a moaner<br />\nI&#8217;m totally over corona.<br />\nI&#8217;m feeling just like the phoner,<br />\nWho certainly isn&#8217;t a loner,<br />\nBecoming bovine or bovid &#8211;<br />\nWe&#8217;re<br />\nTotally<br />\nOver<br />\nCovid.</p>\n<p>SEE http://balconyfever.com</p>\n <p>It&#8217;s hard to live in a pandemic<br />\nIt&#8217;s hard to live in a pandemic when your parents are essential workers<br />\nIt&#8217;s hard to live in a pandemic when your sister screams every time the news comes on<br />\nIt&#8217;s hard to live in a pandemic when you know your great grandma&#8217;s spending her 91st all alone </p>\n<p>But despite this I am grateful<br />\nGrateful for the selfless front line workers who shift after shift, put themselves at risk for our own benefit,<br />\nGrateful for technology, for being the shining beacon that has saved our sanity<br />\nAnd grateful for my family, for being the rock that’s there to say &#8216;everything&#8217;s going to be okay&#8217;</p>\n<p>Because of them I know it will be.</p>\n<p>Whether it be in a month, 2, or even a year, of course it&#8217;s going to get better, because it always does.</p>\n<p>We have the Aussie spirit on our side, a curve we hope to never flatten.</p>\n <p>(Part 2)<br />\nThere I go, leading myself down the garden path this time. Oh, that’s a lovely thought, a walk down the garden path, but is it allowed in these Covid Times, (sounds like a medical journal). Anyway, I’ll ring the seniors’ hotline and ask them. I might even get to talk to that lovely Brendan Murphy if he can get his head out of Morrison’s arse long enough to take a call. Oh, I did remind myself that I want to tell you about a senior’s thing. Back to the Queensland Premier. You know the one with the parents who can’t spell in English. Anastasia Palawhatsit, yesterday launched ‘Adopt a Senior’. Now, I might be officially an orphan but I don’t want to be adopted by some family with a houseful of snotty-nosed kids or have Brianna &amp; Ethan call me on their $1000 </p>\n<p>Apples while wearing their Nikes and H &amp; Ms. Did you understand anything I just said? I didn’t. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oops, back again, just dropped off for a minute or two. Where was I? &#8230;. I know it’s cool to number iterations of things these days, like Windows 10, Snowy Hydro2.0 etc. But was I asleep during the previous 18 versions of Covid.</p>\n<p>Wait a sec, there’s a message coming through&#8230;..apparently I have run out of time&#8230;because&#8230; someone else, somewhere in Australia, wants to use the NBN and there can only be two using it at the same time. Hang on there while I press SEND&#8230; Bugger! I just sent this to Rigby as well. He’ll probably unfriend me now. Is that what they say? Anyway I’ll now have one less friend, but that’s OK. As I’m now only allowed to have one friend at a time , I’m glad it’s you.</p>\n <p>This was the year where everyone thought &#8220;new me&#8221;, &#8220;new decade&#8221;, &#8220;new things&#8221;. I thought that too. I went to Brisbane five days after New Years and it was a wonderful way to spend the start of the year. But, who knew a wave of terror was going to hit us. Right after I came back from Brisbane to Sydney. The news came, a deadly virus in China. Didn&#8217;t think much off it. Two weeks later. The virus has spread to many countries and the cases in China were rising drastically.</p>\n<p>Everyone was scared and everyone didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen. CO-VID19 IS NAMED PANDEMIC. Some people thought it was nothing and laughed it off and I really wanted to tell them, NO, it is something and it is concerning and it is dangerous.</p>\n<p>I just finished playing sport one Friday when I found out that NAPLAN was cancelled. I was kinda happy but worried as well. WEEK 8 Tuesday was my last day of school. It was on March 24th. The date today is May the 8th. I&#8217;m going back to school for one day a week from next week. I liked spending time at home though, I spent a lot more time with my family. </p>\n<p>The future is untold.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of the commercially advertised Mother&#8217;s Day but this year is different.  I am looking forward to hosting breakfast for 2 daughters and twin grandsons at nearly 7 and one grandson at 3 who I haven&#8217;t seen for 6 weeks.  </p>\n<p>Pancakes, breakfast muffins and croissants with jam and loads of coffee is on the menu.  Pop has set up the Wii to bowl with the boys. It&#8217;ll be a bit old skool for them but they are both sporty and competitive so it should be fun.</p>\n<p>I think this lockdown will change my mind about how precious time is and not to take it for granted. </p>\n <p>It&#8217;s been a week since restrictions have been lifted, although our situation isn&#8217;t getting better. People aren&#8217;t taking this seriously.</p>\n<p>But all I can think about is going back to normal. Will it ever be the same as before? Will I be able to go where ever I want without having to worry about keeping my distance or touching my face? Will my loved ones come out the end of this? It is the uncertainty that everyone is afraid of, because really, we don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that nursing home in Penrith did not expect to be contaminated with the virus but et here we are, 15 innocent deaths.</p>\n<p>School is coming back soon, but I for one know it is going to be very different. </p>\n <p>It&#8217;s the small things&#8230;</p>\n<p>A hot cup of tea in bed every morning at 6, brought to me by a husband who bemoans his inability to sleep past 5am but makes good use of that pre-dawn time (to my way of thinking anyway)</p>\n<p>The view from my study window: showers of golden leaves when it&#8217;s windy, watching the satiny plumage of a male bower bird foraging in the tea tree, tiny elegant honeyeaters amongst the lipstick salvia.</p>\n<p>A full pantry and time to make healthy, delicious meals.</p>\n<p>Knowing that my loved ones have so far weathered the viral storm.</p>\n<p>Taking chocolates to my 91 year old Mum in her nursing home (now I&#8217;m allowed to actually visit instead of talking through an open window), reading her one of the short stories I&#8217;ve written in isolation mode.</p>\n<p>The technology that allows me to see and hear my family, including two grandkids who I&#8217;m missing, and friends.</p>\n<p>Balancing all of these is the knowledge that so many others, all around the world, do not have these small, huge gifts.</p>\n<p>I am grateful that I do.</p>\n <p>My name is Archer Hopwood I am 13 years old. I live in the hunter valley in a place called Wallarobba It is 15 minutes away from Dungog, that is the closest town. Wallarrobba is just an area. I go to school in Maitland which is 45 minutes away and the school is called All Saints college Maitland. I live on a farm and during COVID- 19 It was the best I had 300 acres But I still had to do my school work, unfortunately, but during school holiday’s I didn’t so I was outside most of the day. </p>\n<p>On my farm, we run cattle and we had just come out of a serve drought, at least we didn’t have COVID-19 and a drought because that would have been horrendous. The weather at the moment is near perfect, looking out of my window from my desk I can see the hills with a morning due and the sun shining and I have to be inside when I could be riding my horse and doing jobs around the house. I love homeschooling because I don’t have to travel anywhere and when I have a break I can go outside and I don’t have to pack food and that I can go to the pantry and have all of the options also homeschooling I find it a lot easier and I finish earlier because I work on my own and I don’t have to wait for annoying students so I can then go outside. I am not like normal kids I don’t have any gaming consoles or anything. </p>\n <p>On the 16th March, 2020 the enormity of CoVid-19 and its destructive path, compelled me to write this Prayer from my Heart!</p>\n<p>Holy Father, Blessed Jesus, Holy Mary, St Joseph, All Saints in Heaven,<br />\nWe our faithful people on Earth, gathered in Lockdown praying alone at home,<br />\nHumbly pray to you in Heaven above, to bless, protect and keep us safe from CoVid-19, which is killing thousands on earth.</p>\n<p>This Virus is also threatening, endangering our health, animals, our food supply, placing Australia and the whole world in immense danger for the future.</p>\n<p>Dear God, We ask you to spare our Families, Relatives, Friends, and Our Aged.  Protect our Religious, Health, Social Workers and Governments here and throughout our beautiful World.<br />\nBestow them wisdom, strength, caring and health for their daily work.</p>\n<p>Dear Holy Mary, Mother of God, Our Mother, Cover us with your mantle of gentleness and protection.  Give us Peace, bestow our families and children comfort and hope for the future.</p>\n<p>We pray that you intercept on our behalf to God Almighty, Our Creator, that He will heal those already affected, comfort the moribund, and bless our beloved Elderly in the forefront of this cruel modern pandemic.</p>\n<p>All Angels and Saints in Heaven, we look up to you to also intercede on our behalf!</p>\n<p>Almighty God we are in your hands.   More than ever we need your comfort.    We LOVE, PRAY and PRAISE YOU, to learn from this to make and keep our Earth a better, safer, healthier place.  AMEN   </p>\n <p>Saw an elderly couple yesterday alive and happy doing shopping and feeling grateful that we have looked after our most vulnerable by social distancing and self isolating. I also feel proud for assisting our health care system by staying at home and looking after the well-being of our healthcare workers.</p>\n <p>The family is all here, all day every day. I’m actually amazed that we are managing so well. I wouldn’t say I’m at my most effective work wise, but I’m loving that I can make it from my bed to yoga class in the lounge room in 4 minutes. After a rocky few weeks as work did the Covid19 pivot, things have settled and we know what we’re doing. </p>\n<p>The rabbit’s happy, its licking feet during hubby’s sit-ups and snuggling up with Ma during shavasana. Everyone is dropping food in his bowl throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Mr 18 is doing well with first year uni though he’s turned nocturnal, exams now online and the study flows on from HSC but he’s loving studying what he enjoys the focus on maths n physics. Is he really my son? Missing his gym, the backyard one has lost its appeal as the temperature drops and the make do arrangement is not cutting it. </p>\n<p>Mr 15 is finally grasping study from home, in a silent world where communication is flowing between him and his school buddies. Lots going on but quiet on the outside. It’s given him an appreciation of being in the classroom he still prefers that interaction. Can’t wait for him to get out on the soccer field. Hard to get either of them out the door into the fresh air. </p>\n<p>Hubby is doing well as Uni goes totally on line and he has to prepare for teaching next semester. For a technophobe he’s going great guns embracing online learning as a necessity. Will be interesting to see how UNSW copes with the massive loss in income this year, with such reliance on OS students to keep the profits rolling in.</p>\n<p>So there we have it diary entry for today</p>\n <p>Dear M,</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since we last spoke. I figured now was the best time to reach out&#8230;well better late than never.</p>\n<p>Most mornings I wake up and wonder if I&#8217;m still dreaming or not. The only way I can really tell that this is real life and not a dream is you&#8217;re not there to wake me up. I wake up later these days, maybe it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t have work anymore or any other commitments. I think it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s quiet, peaceful since restrictions came in but at the same time an unnerving kind of quiet.   </p>\n<p>I think humanity had high hopes for the year 2020, a new decade and all. I sure had high hopes. After seven long gruelling years of study and I had finally finished, hoping to graduate and start a new chapter. I never pictured that chapter with worldwide pandemics or where all the days, weeks and months blur together in isolation. I guess there&#8217;s some truth to the saying life happens when you&#8217;re busy making other plans. I&#8217;ll mention that isolation makes you very lonely and I usually end up missing my work and wishing you were here talk to. I would of loved to pick your brain on this whole situation from the bewildering loss of toilet paper and social distancing to the endless conspiracies on how this pandemic happened. </p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t really say how this chapter will play out but it will definitely be quite a transition for all of us.</p>\n<p>Until we speak again,</p>\n <p>There is no greater feeling than lying awake in a winter bed. The covers protect me from the cold air that fills my room.</p>\n<p>Normally, I would have to force myself out of bed, stroll to the coffee machine and await my fate for the day.<br />\nToday, like the past several weeks, I have been given the gift of time. </p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the nation into self-isolation, and with that a forced sense of boredom. I have been keeping myself busy. Exploring the depth of the internet, the pile of clothes in the corner of my room and the patience of my siblings. But it is on cold mornings like today, that I stay in bed much longer than I should. </p>\n<p>Is it weird I gain so much comfort from this place? The confines of my bedroom covers act as safety from the cold morning air. I lay awake, eyes closed thinking of when I should move. Thinking that if I count down from ten I will be able to face the wrath of the outside world. Yet I stay, for what seems like minutes and becomes hours on end. I stay in the depths of the covers, imagining all the possible things I could have done today, but did not.</p>\n<p>There is no greater feeling that lying awake in a winter bed, until the moment comes when you step out from under the blanket that protects and into the unknown of the day. One step and the feeling is gone. But there is another that comes with this, one that is far greater than a winter bed. </p>\n <p>I went to Bakers Delight to get my daily bread.</p>\n<p>A sign at the entrance &#8211; &#8220;Only three customers in the shop at one time&#8221;. Three spots are marked on the floor to guide customers to keep Social Distancing requirement.   I joined the queue of 5 outside @ 2m spacing along the curb.</p>\n<p>A huge fellow in the queue in front of me.  We all wait patiently &#8211; the queue advances.  The huge fellow is next to go in the shop.  An elderly lady approaches and goes straight into the shop!</p>\n<p>In a booming voice (not nasty, almost apologetic) Excuse me Madam &#8211; The queue starts up the road!  The elderly lady looks around to realise it&#8217;s she that is being spoken to, shocked, mouth agape, she realises she has transgressed.  Then all in a flutter she exits the shop and moves to the head of the queue.  The booming voice &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry Madam, but we&#8217;re all in this together. </p>\n<p>Still in shock and still in a flutter she doesn&#8217;t join the queue, but keeps going down the street &#8211; probably missed her daily bread. :-(</p>\n <p>The time of our lives..</p>\n<p>We hadn&#8217;t had an overseas holiday in 3 years, so when all this started we were having the time of our lives in New Zealand. It didn&#8217;t feel real.</p>\n<p>Then we arrived home, Sydney airport was.. weird. The staff were nice, but it was strange seeing masked Australians greet us instead of warm smiles. We made it to our car in record time, we had a flat battery &#8211; was this the start of 2 weeks quarantine!</p>\n<p>Thankfully we were allowed home, it felt good but scary. We can&#8217;t leave for two weeks, can&#8217;t see our loved ones after 4 weeks away. We survived and thrived in our new home/work environment &#8211; mostly. </p>\n<p>Suddenly days had rolled into weeks and we could now see our family, walking 1.5metres apart. It felt great, sharing walks with my sister saved my sanity. </p>\n<p>I work in a tourist facility, we were told 4 weeks then our jobs would be reassesed. I worked harder than ever before, learning new technologies, building new webpages, throwing myself into producing engaging &#8216;SOCIAL MEDIA&#8217; content. I hated it, but I love my job and my team, and my historic buildings. COVID &#8211; 19 would not change that.</p>\n<p>I found a lump last week.  The possibility of a new medical condition in this &#8216;new&#8217; world. Fear is different now..</p>\n <p>    One day a long time from now I hope to have kids and when that time comes I want to be able to tell them of the year 2020. That it started with bushfires that tore through Australia, then the next thing I would remember is self-isolation and Covid-19</p>\n<p>     Hopefully by then I would have published my first book and I would tell my children about the first novel I ever finished.</p>\n<p>     &#8216;I was in high school,&#8217; I would say to them. &#8216;I was bored in the classes that I had to have over Microsoft Teams because the world was in self-isolation due to a pandemic, the first one in about 100 years.&#8217;</p>\n<p>   I would pause and they&#8217;d ask questions and I would try to remember more clearly.</p>\n<p>   &#8216;Everyone had told us that this was a great time to do something. I would see the world outside, people were running and sometimes I would take out on my shoes, but end up never doing anything.</p>\n<p>    I got bored, bored of Netflix, bored of the constant news of Covid. So I wrote a book to distract myself from my anxiety and loneliness,&#8217; I would say this, but the young kids would want to know about whether anyone came back from the dead as Zombies and I would laugh, nod and maybe tell a made up story of a zombie apocalypse.</p>\n<p>    I&#8217;d tell them about them about the novel I wrote and about the videos we saw of the empty cities around the world. I would tell them about the hope everyone had in the middle of this crisis that the environment was able to repair itself so fast.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of stories, real and fiction, but this experience is our story. </p>\n <p>This moment in time. </p>\n<p>Imagine being stuck at home with nothing to do for reoccurring months. Just twiddling your thumbs and being bored to death. Oh wait, that’s what we’re experiencing today. Days drain on and on. It’s like we’re robots repeating the same thing every single day. Eat, sleep, repeat.</p>\n<p>People might say that a nightmare is a creepy clown chasing you or being cornered by zombies. But when I think of a nightmare, I picture the coronavirus as today’s spooky story. Well, maybe that is a fair bit exaggerated, but it isn’t the most pleasant thing in the world. There is 3.76 million confirmed cases and 264 000 deaths of the virus in Australia today. When will this end? Well, will this end? Fortunately, the spread has slowed down. </p>\n<p>I have learnt many things from this experience. One of them is to not to take things for granted. I miss being able to go out and enjoy myself at any place, not just essential services! </p>\n<p>My mind can’t make up which direction it’s going in. Is it the road to boredom at 200 km/h? Or is it on the relaxed road? Then will it take a U turn and land on school tension and stress road? But it’s okay, my brain can use a little traffic jam now and then.</p>\n<p>I would tell my future self to enjoy exploring outside, travelling to places and spending time with friends. Because out of nowhere a virus might appear. </p>\n <p>Not that long ago I made a diary entry because I had felt like this coronavirus was such a nightmare, however, now I am looking back to it and it isn&#8217;t so bad to what it actually is now (in the future).</p>\n<p>20 March 2020<br />\n&#8220;Hey diary, since 2014 the relatives have come to Australia and they loved it. This year our trip over there has been cancelled due to this conflict in COVID. The whole of Italy is in lockdown and I haven&#8217;t been able to sleep properly because of how worried I am. In another 2 months I will be turning 13, but yet again I don&#8217;t know whether it will be cancelled. Year 8 is different&#8230; I guess a nice kind of different, but one thing I need to know at the moment is that things do get better&#8230; Later diary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Well after reading that you would never of thought about what we are going through only 2 months after! Now I am waking up at 8:55 in the morning and quickly getting ready before school starts, crazy right. Well, you are right I guess.<br />\nIf I were to make another diary entry to match the other one it would go a little bit like this&#8230;</p>\n<p>8 May 2020<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s me diary, but this time I&#8217;m here writing because I read my other entry and&#8230; I just don&#8217;t know, right now at the minute I&#8217;m writing for my English task and I&#8217;m at home! Yesterday our car lost a battle fighting against a kangaroo and I still don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ll do anything for my 13th birthday in 11 days. We have had our good things like being a happy family and staying safe from coronavirus. But I guess sometimes things get worse.<br />\nLater&#8221;</p>\n<p>But imagine without&#8230;</p>\n <p>I wake up each morning thankful for the sun, the birds I hear chirping in the trees, my home, my job and the ability to work from home.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been seven weeks since lockdown, but life still goes on. I&#8217;ve adopted a kitten, had more time to read, think, reflect, walk around the neighbourhood. It is the simple things which mean the most.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve marvelled watching my brother heading out for his nightshift stacking shelves at Woolies, my mum and friends still working in the schools and hospitals. Yes, we are all in this together, but some more so than others. We are not in all ways equally affected by this.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been amazed and inspired by the generosity of artists, musicians and entertainers, whom we all turn to in a crisis to nourish our souls and spirits. For continuing to do what you do in incredibly difficult circumstances and with little support, I salute you!</p>\n<p>To my flamenco teacher whose income stream of gigs and classes were cancelled because of the pandemic, and whose Zoom classes not only continue to educate, inspire and keep us emotionally and physically fit, but give purpose and employment to artists overseas as well, I thank you.</p>\n<p>Although we are physically apart, socially and artistically the world has come together &#8211; sharing stories, music, dance and art.</p>\n <p>Corona Virus&#8217; Moment in Time &#8211; By Monica Asimus</p>\n<p>The world is spinning out of control<br />\nIt is changing to a place that I know,<br />\nIs not the same.</p>\n<p>Doctors and nurses on the front line<br />\nPutting their lives at risk,<br />\nTrying to save people who are dying, everyday<br />\nRight in front of their sad and gloomy eyes.</p>\n<p>Scientists are seating,<br />\nTheir racing the virus.<br />\nIt is a global pandemic,<br />\nAnd we are not quite there yet.</p>\n<p>Being in a global lock down<br />\nHaving to stand 1.5 meters apart.<br />\nSanitizer in your hands,<br />\nWearing face masks everywhere you go<br />\nAnd washing your hands constantly<br />\nAfraid of sore throats.</p>\n<p>Staying at home<br />\nWith the virus out and about.<br />\nJust like a lion wait for it&#8217;s prey.<br />\nWeek and weeks in isolation.<br />\nI am like a little lonely bear.</p>\n<p>Tired of the screen,<br />\nWith online learning<br />\nI just can’t get enough.</p>\n<p>Downloading the Skye app,<br />\nJust to communicate with friends<br />\nThe boredom is endless.</p>\n<p>Watching Netflix,<br />\nAnd lying on the couch.<br />\nPajamas are allowed<br />\nEach day is the same.<br />\nNothing has changed.</p>\n<p>When this is over,<br />\nWe will never again, take for granted<br />\nFull shelves at the store<br />\nConversations with neighbors<br />\nLaughter and chatter with out friends<br />\nShopping at Green hills<br />\nSwimming at the beach<br />\nA full crowd at the movies<br />\nFriday nights out, having fun<br />\nDoing what we love.<br />\nA routine full of activities<br />\nAfternoon training sessions<br />\nThe rush to school each morning<br />\nAnd the stadiums coming to live at night.</p>\n<p>With each deep breath we take<br />\nA boring week goes by<br />\n6 weeks going on to 7 in isolation.<br />\nWhen will this be over?<br />\nI want to live my life.</p>\n <p>Dear diary,</p>\n<p>This isolation has been rough, not seeing any of my friends, no sport and being mainly stuck at home. One thing this has taught me is to appreciate the good moments with my friends and the wins, even loss&#8217;s of sport.</p>\n<p>Suprisingly I am not sick of my family yet, I&#8217;m actually quite grateful this happened as it has brought us all closer, we have had family game nights, everyone finally at the dinner table at the same time and my siblings and I have spent nights in each others rooms having fun and laughing to everything.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start off with, but now I am used to it and worked my was around things to help settle down a little. I do miss seeing my grandparents, considering we would see them and my cousins every sunday for family night I still haven&#8217;t really got used to not doing it.</p>\n<p>One thing i will now know, never take anything for granted because one day it could all be taken away from us, for good.</p>\n <p>Social distancing<br />\nYou from me, or me from you?<br />\nWhen will this all end?</p>\n <p>I am a working mother of 2. When the Covid-19 crisis hit in January/February 2020, my anxiety levels went through the roof. Both my children are in primary school, I work in administration in a High school and my husband works in Medical Centre IT.</p>\n<p>Schools in NSW didn&#8217;t close. We are open for essential workers, and as I am expected to go into work everyday with no work from home option, nothing has changed for us with this crisis.</p>\n<p>My anxiety is extremely heightened. I am using as much protection as available to prevent infection. We have masks and gloves but the children do not wear them at school.</p>\n<p>Washing hands has become a requirement at every possible opportunity. When we arrive home at the end of the day we change our clothes and wash our hands and faces. I wash clothes every day and am acutely aware of what we touch and I have become OCD with cleaning the house and doorknob hygiene.</p>\n<p>Most of the world is in isolation with work from home options and boredom videos and &#8216;things to do in quarantine&#8217; filling the internet.</p>\n<p>I long for this. I want the quarantine. I want to be at home with my children, keeping them safe.</p>\n <p>This isn&#8217;t how I envisaged I&#8217;d be celebrating a milestone birthday. In isolation.</p>\n<p>The impact of co-vid19 has been world wide. &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; has been my mantra. I have so much gratitude for the front line workers going way and beyond to keep everyone safe.</p>\n<p>Keeping in touch with family and friends via Facetime and Zoom has been a positive outcome. Mum looks well, sitting in her room at the aged care facility. No visitors are permitted. Counting down the days when I can hug her. The screen bounces to life with two giggling, leaping grandkids, asking me to draw, read and play games. One Facetime session shared with them went on for two hours. We blow kisses and scream &#8220;I love you&#8221;. Counting down the days when I can hug them. I received a picture of Dante wrapped in the blanket that I knitted. My daughter&#8217;s chihuahua/pug all snug and warm. Counting down the days when I can hug him (and her).</p>\n<p>My husband has just returned from being permitted to have a swim at Bronte. His daily ritual has been upended. We hug and feel blessed to be where we are right here and now. Turning 60 ain&#8217;t all that bad! Cheers.</p>\n <p>I am starting to become really accustomed to my COVID-19 isolation routine.</p>\n<p>Going back to the regular daily grind may prove to be interesting I feel, should restrictions gradually begin to lift. I am not entirely sure that being used to it is even a good thing&#8211;socially speaking, it has been a rather slow time. I am well and truly in my own head 80% of the time if I am not working remotely.</p>\n<p>I am one of the luckier ones&#8230;working four jobs over the last year or so has proven useful&#8211;I was stood down by one job, work dried up for two others due to restrictions on gatherings and the like&#8230;one has remained and seen me through the last six weeks. So between working that single job (tutoring) via online delivery, I have spent countless hours walking, completing the last two units of my second university degree, delving into the many genealogical mysteries my family seems to possess and writing.</p>\n<p>I am busy, but not spread thin like I usually am when all jobs are going full ball. Perhaps the pandemic has been a sign that I need to drop a job. That was made even more obvious when I was asked to come back to the one job that doesn&#8217;t hold much relevance to my future career today&#8230;the lack of excitement on my part was palpable. Time to consider some permanent changes to my working schedule post restrictions.</p>\n <p>Dear Grandma (Myrtle)</p>\n<p>Things have changed since you left us all those years ago. I know that you went through some major world events and lived a more frugal and simpler way of life than I. You always gave us positive comments and love when we were children particularly when we stayed with you during the school holidays where we enjoyed our trips to Manly on the ferry and to the Coles Cafeteria in the City.</p>\n<p>You made use clothes and knitted us jumpers for the winter and kissed and cuddled us when we saw you always greeting us with a smile. You were then and still now looking over us.</p>\n<p>Now I am a grandmother and I can&#8217;t cuddle my granddaughter or my daughters and family because we have a pandemic. I have been able to see my granddaughter but always at arms length not a natural way to be. I hope we can have a hug again soon because it&#8217;s not good for humans to keep their distance only at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>I visit Mum your daughter in law behind a glass window in the nursing home. She is confused in this strange new world. We haven&#8217;t been allowed to visit for the last seven weeks but have made arrangements to go to see her tomorrow. Seven weeks is a long time at ninety one and with failing health she is longing to be in heaven with our beloved Dad your son.</p>\n<p>Each day I wake thinking this is a bad dream but the morning sun still shines in through the window and brings hope that this moment will soon pass and we&#8217;ll connect with our families and friends again and build a better world where we all appreciate each other and the life we have.</p>\n <p>I suffer from mental illness. But that very sentence is one I&#8217;ve not used before now.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m ashamed or unable to admit it to myself, rather that I prefer not to use the term suffer as it is one that usually denotes physical pain. But what else is there to describe it. There is no joy in having this condition.<br />\nMajor Depressive Disorder, Clinical Depression, there are plenty of names for it but few to describe having it.</p>\n<p>My condition has eroded my confidence and destroyed my social skills to the point where social isolation is the norm for me so I am not feeling the effects of the &#8220;lockdown&#8221; as much as others. In fact, I&#8217;m not really bothered by it at all, my existence has barely changed. I don&#8217;t like going shopping, nor do I like sports, about the only thing I miss is live music. Even though I&#8217;m not fond of crowds.</p>\n<p>In truth, the biggest difference for me during the covid-19 pandemic is the unfortunately temporary relief from the poverty one finds themselves enduring whilst on Centrelink payments.</p>\n <p>It&#8217;s weird to see my friends again for the first time in a month, to know all the stress and fears they&#8217;ve experienced and to not be able to give them a hug.</p>\n<p>School is going ahead as usual, because we have no other choice. Some of our HSC assessments were cancelled, but now the focus is on trials and learning the final bits of content. If anything, the focus on academics has ramped up as almost all out of school activities have been cancelled.</p>\n<p>It is both distressing and strangely comforting that with everything changing there seems to be one constant. School may shut down, pandemics may be declared and life as I know it may be cancelled, but I can always rely on being told that the HSC is the most important thing in my life.</p>\n <p>My experience of Covid 19 has been overshadowed by a more personal crisis. My husband was diagnosed with Brain cancer on 6 March just as the panic about the virus started to set in. We were so shocked as the symptoms were not obvious to us and my husband is very fit. Suddenly just when I needed support from my family and friends they were not able to see us because of the new social distancing rules. All our plans for the year came crashing down.</p>\n<p>We are receiving lots of phone calls and messages from everyone and video calls as well. These keep us in touch with the world. My mum, brother and sisters all live in the UK. They are locked down far more than we are. Mum hasn’t left her house for 2 months. She has wonderful neighbours which makes me happy.</p>\n<p>My niece’s planned wedding in London was cancelled and of course my flight to attend it is also cancelled. Mum (who was widowed last September) was due to return to Sydney with my brother and me. All now cancelled. Husband is going through chemotherapy and is on his 3rd round. He is going well. It is all so weird that we can’t see our two sons and their families. No one can visit us because of husband’s low immunity even now the restrictions are lessened.</p>\n<p>I am feeling better for having a haircut yesterday, Just Cuts is open again, but have to be so careful. Everyone is getting used to distancing and you find yourself giving way to people like when you are driving.</p>\n<p>People are kinder than before.</p>\n <p>Ruby Princess<br />\n(to tune/pace/piano of Ruby Tuesday by the Rolling Stones)</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt at all, where you came from<br />\nStowed away on board, among the throng.<br />\nStole a ride on every breath,<br />\nSeems many missed the smell of death,<br />\nFound out too late<br />\nIt’s such a fate.</p>\n<p>So Goodbye Ruby Princess!<br />\nWe’re gonna hang our shame on you.<br />\nAin’t no blame sittin’ on our shoulders,<br />\nSo we’re gonna diss you.</p>\n<p>Two thousand walked the plank, at Circular Quay<br />\nWho let them all ashore?

Is this the best song ever to come out in these Corona times??]</p>\n <p>I’m tired.</p>\n<p>We did not do a lot today, and for some reason it made me feel tired.<br />\nMaybe because I was busy with pretend play all day! My mum says that entails a lot of work. Maybe she is right. But I am not sure.</p>\n<p>Good night.</p>\n <p>I had an altercation with a distant friend, online, naturally.</p>\n<p>I had posted that I&#8217;ve been able to work through the pandemic &#8211; as an assistant nurse. I am assured that this is a frontline job but I feel so small compared to the giants of RNs and Docs I work with. This fact that I can work, for once in my life, I am purely proud of me and my part.</p>\n<p>You see, I suffer with the black dog &#8211; depression. And the feeling of inadequacy. I&#8217;ve worked hard to get where I am, and so in this happiness I posted this fact, without really thinking of others reaction &#8211; admittantly.<br />\nBut the reaction did happen. Two friends told me I was being insensitive to them. They both work in the arts industry, where my passion used to be. And within a few days, they had lost their dream and jobs, they told of their friends being made homeless and how they were depressed amongst other friend doing the job of 3 because their bosses dont have money coming in. I was worried and tried to assure them that the industry will be needed after all this is over! I miss the Theatre!</p>\n<p>They assured me I was being horrid and to think about what I post.</p>\n<p>I kept thay post up &#8211; you know why? Because in a time when everyone is affected, there needs to be someone that is proud of their part.</p>\n<p>Depression is a reality. I can attest. But I know if I hadn&#8217;t done the work I&#8217;ve done on me, I would be saying what they are saying to another steady and proud friend.</p>\n<p>This is a time of lifting each other up. If you can&#8217;t say anything nice&#8230; keep scrolling.</p>\n <p>Today went past again — same as yesterday and the day before. But then it is always different. We hardly get a chance to really see how much we do accomplish in a day so the diary is a good thing. It allows us to reflect on the day and discover what we have done, how we felt and how we are at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>My son and I spent the day talking on-and-off with each other about the Thunderbirds board game that we started to play last night. He is into collaborative games at the moment, and he is loving all the different rules. As much as I am an advocate of collaborative activities — as opposed to competitive ones — for his age, I realise that my head spins trying to work out the many different rules and options that these cooperative games offer! Before we even begin the game, I am exhausted.</p>\n<p>And then the game begins, and for the life of me, I only hope the game will end soon.</p>\n<p>But my son loves it! He imagines himself to be in the game. So he strategises and thinks of how to go past the dangers and challenges without being defeated by them. But luck plays a part in these games, and one relies on chance for certain events or circumstances that happen as you open every card. Sometimes, the game ends and all players fail to accomplish the mission.<br />\nSounds so familiar, isn’t it? (Wink)</p>\n<p>Tomorrow is another day. We might end up playing another collaborative game — Ravine. That and some lessons for him and a little bit of work for me.</p>\n <p>I am really enjoying this time in isolation. Since I can wake up when my body is ready to I often stay up late listening to You Tubes and watching shows like “Phantom of the Opera.</p>\n<p>I’ve thrown out or passed on goods which I no longer need and I am growing some food.</p>\n<p>I am doing Pilates, Qigong, walking and cycling. I have time to sit in the sun or swing in the hammock.</p>\n<p>I have learnt to use Zoom and WhatsApp and host a weekly coffee morning tea and a philosophy talk. I spent time reading to my granddaughter on WhatsApp, followed by a Duplo building completion. Then I followed her and brother via WhatsApp on their bikes before the final dart competition.</p>\n<p>I’ve learnt how to order things online and have been cooking tasty recipes from YouTube. Most importantly I have learnt to do self-body and face massage since I’d been missing my regular remedial massages.</p>\n<p>Days are passing very quickly and I still have more jobs to do around the house. I hope isolation doesn’t end just yet as I know once it does these will go on the “To do sometime list”.</p>\n<p>I think about some of the great things which have happened like parents spending quality time with their kids and reduced greenhouse emissions.<br />\nI have found since everyone is in the same boat people are more friendly. The difference is how we feel about it. In my area we put a green ribbon on the letter box if everything is fine and a red one if we need help with something.</p>\n<p>My hope is that we each take some part of these new habits with us when isolation finishes so that the new world is better than the one we were isolated from.</p>\n <p>Now that restrictions are being eased, I left the house to go to the local shops for the first time this week, and it didn&#8217;t go well.</p>\n<p>I knew that not being able to make regular trips to populated areas would affect my progress but I had hoped that my awareness of this would somehow reduce the severity but it didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I used to make sure I went somewhere public once a week. Just to keep control of it. But after 9 weeks at home there was no way that I was getting through this without a relapse.</p>\n<p>So now I&#8217;m reduced to being able to go out in the car so long as I don&#8217;t have to get out. And I can still take my son for walks in the nearby bush. But beyond that my agoraphobia is too strong. Irrational but in control.</p>\n<p>A lot of work will be need to get back to where I was and I need to stop myself from feeling like all the work I previously did was wasted. But I&#8217;m hopefully and I know I have people around me to support me.</p>\n<p>But right now, as I lie comfortably in my bed, wrapped up securely in my blanket, the house still and quiet, I find it hard to convince myself that I can&#8217;t just stay here, like this, safe and content, forever.</p>\n <p>I’ve been locked down before.</p>\n<p>At the age of nine, in 1956, I spent 10 weeks in the children’s ward at Fremantle Hospital with rheumatic fever. The recovery was slow and long, and my muscles wasted away until, by the time I was medically fit, I had to build enough limb strength so I could start to walk again.</p>\n<p>I can see now that what I lacked back then was a memory store. With only a few years of memorable experiences to turn over in my mind, boredom hovered relentlessly. Today, it’s different. One of the (very few) advantages of being 73 is that I have an almost-limitless storehouse of memories to explore and I have, thankfully, retained the cognitive ability to retrieve, examine and re-archive them.</p>\n<p>The covid-19 epidemic has choked off opportunities for new experiences, and their propensity to occupy front-of-mind at the expense of older memories. Some of these are validated by photographs, letters, and the occasional diary entry. It’s not unusual to find that a remembered event wasn’t quite like that, when you check the available references.</p>\n<p>Then there are the projects that don’t require outdoors activity. One of my grandsons is eagerly anticipating his inheritance of my father’s roll-top desk, which I’m busy refurbishing for him. It will be 60 years old when he sits down at it, and reads the provenance statement that documents the pathway to his ownership. Somehow, I also have to find time to explore the life of a Frenchman who, I’ve just discovered, is almost certainly my missing great-great-grandfather. Not to mention the nagging guilt that I’ve promised to write an entry for the Indigenous Dictionary of Australian Biography, and haven’t yet started on it.</p>\n<p>No, covid-19, you don’t frighten me. I haven’t got time to be frightened.</p>\n <p>I think I am falling in love.</p>\n<p>Falling, because it is downward projection.<br />\nLove, because I have this innate feeling inside of me that has been awoken. It sends my hands shaking and muffles my brain as I instead follow the sounds of my heart pumping.</p>\n<p>I think I am falling in love.</p>\n<p>But falling in love with someone is not the same as falling in love with an idea.<br />\nI see a picture of where I want to be, a vision. I replay the moments that have passed in my head on repeat like ferris wheel spinning, and stopping, spinning, and stopping.</p>\n<p>I think I am falling in love.<br />\nWith who? With what? I do not know.<br />\nBut my heart strings are loose and they are being tugged as my feet shuffle closer and my eyes grow bigger.<br />\nI am falling, falling, falling deeper into the unknown. Drowning, drowning, drowning deeper into the sea.<br />\nLove has succumbed me, wrapped me in its depths, pushed me off a cliff and waited, waited, waited for me to hit the ground.</p>\n <p>A sunny day. I would have been back from Sydney and still in jet-lag but instead I faced another spring in Switzerland. Swore never to do that again. Hayfever changes everything . Gabilliet said EVERYONE loves spring but he is wrong. TS Eliot was sort of right. It is a cruel time.</p>\n<p>As soon as you begin to write a diary you know will be seen you begin to fake it. There&#8217;s a brilliant section in Taleb&#8217;s The Black Swan on the problem of diaries, he is referring more to the faking that goes into rewriting, when the future has become the past, and the totally unknown has become the obvious, but I think the minute a public is involved you are rewriting, &#8230; cheating as it were.</p>\n<p>They are going to open the libraries in Zurich again next Monday. something to look forward to. It&#8217;s not like I need more books, but I like to look at them. &#8221; Why Minsky Matters &#8221; arrived yesterday. I was really happy, I read the opening chapter with delight. But I have a horrible feeling it is going to get technical and boring. Hopefully I can bicycle again next week, and not get breathed on by joggers and cyclists along the river . Everything is stressful, shopping, library, even walking in the forest. I have not caught a train for 6 weeks or so. Cancelled the automatic renewal of my annual rail pass. Was thinking fondly of the Ethnographic Museum Library in Geneva this morning while working up a drawing. It would be nice to get out of the house</p>\n <p>&#8220;In this strange new world&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>I get this a lot in all my emails from teachers. Because they have to email me now. That is the strange new world we live in.</p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t mind it. Of course it isn&#8217;t due to any nice circumstances but I&#8217;m enjoying it. This is coming from an introvert after all.</p>\n<p>It was hard at first. I&#8217;m not very good at routines and procrastination is probably my best friend. Not the two things you want when trying to complete year 12 in quarantine.</p>\n<p>But I got by. I got a rough system that works for me. I&#8217;ve even started learning Spanish and writing a book with my friends. I have a supportive and wacky family. I have cute pets to cuddle when I need it. And the pantry is usually full.</p>\n<p>Life&#8217;s not the best. But it is okay.</p>\n <p>This time has alerted me to the fact that I am getting old. I only turned 70 a few short months ago, celebrating with my family and friends, and am now brutally reminded of it daily. Being isolated as a &#8216;vulnerable person&#8217;, I&#8217;ve had a taste of full retirement. I now know why I&#8217;ve resisted it.</p>\n<p>A librarian, who passionately loves her work, I miss interacting with colleagues, helping people use technology, advising readers, inspiring children to seek the information they need, or discover exciting books to read. Library clients want to find interesting videos, research family or local history, or explore e-resources on their special interests, opinions, likes and dislikes. I miss them.</p>\n<p>While I have work to do, books to read, yoga to practise, walks to walk and Zoom to connect, I can&#8217;t visit my grandchildren interstate, plan a trip, swim in my local pool, go to a concert or theatre, attend a yoga class, socialise, eat out, or enjoy a facial. For the first time in my life, I know what it is to feel old, dependent, irrelevant, unappreciated, not needed. Yes, Zoom, email and the phone keep me connected to family and friends (even yoga) but it&#8217;s just not the same.</p>\n <p>I am hopeful for the first time in months, probably a few years.</p>\n<p>Corona-19 is a sledge hammer to Our collective selve to damn well wake up. What are we doing to ourselves, our planet in pursuit of progress, pursuit of more, more, more and who cares about our neighbours&#8230;&#8230;. especially if the live over the waters.</p>\n<p>We are too cruel and uncaring and the planet bears the brunt of it&#8230;&#8230; the poor and forgotten as we forget and unsee&#8230;&#8230; buying cheap tack from cheap labour, cheap shots that They choose to work for Nothing. Cruel people with cheap shots.</p>\n<p>Covid gives me hope as we are forced to live simply, re consider travel, that We Can put everything on hold. Death to the trolls No matter how metaphorically I also feel hopeful. I have become unemployed overnight but I am hopeful. Something has to give. Be kind.</p>\n <p>Despite my very best intentions to live my best life and present my best self to the world, I&#8217;m no diarist.</p>\n<p>Oh, sure, I fancy myself as a &#8216;man of letters&#8217;, but I&#8217;m peripatetic &amp; all-too-easily distracted.</p>\n<p>All it takes is the prospect of, say, another cup of coffee; a banana muffin; or, worse, another glass of Nero d&#8217;Avola; (or whatever red happens to be open).</p>\n<p>Yet I feel I should have somethings say about life under the cloud of COVID-19 (which I still think should be upgraded, a la Microsoft Word, to reflect the times; it looks like last year&#8217;s model).</p>\n<p>And, I think I do.</p>\n<p>Amidst all the politics, speculation, misinformation, Presidential hamfistedness, death, drama, economic upheaval, mass unemployment, projections of a fifty percent increase in suicide, and so on, many of us are looking for the elusive silver lining.</p>\n<p>Some are given to openly philosophising, even eulogising.</p>\n<p>I, too, am tempted, seduced, by revivalist Aquarianism: a utopian dream of wholesale human awakening, in which, in and around this moment, we will rally, one and all, spontaneously colour-blind brothers and sisters, to unity and a new purpose, casting off the trappings and shackles consumerism, &#8216;success&#8217;, perceived social status and doing; entering a new age of compassion, empathy, sharing &amp; caring. Yea. And verily. I hope it comes to pass.</p>\n<p>Yet I&#8217;m not rushing online, to place a wager in favour of this, on SportsBet. For history tells us how quickly we forget. War. Famine. Plague. Pestilence. Disasters. Natural. And manmade. Even vira. Not to mention, others. Especially those less fortunate.</p>\n<p>Alas. Alack. We are, for all our occasional glimmering, shimmering good, selfish beings. Evolutionary imperative? Probably. A Darwinian drive? I s&#8217;pose. Will a tiny &#8216;disruptor&#8217; really, fundamentally change us, for the better? Mm. Maybe. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n <p>It was around 7:30pm on the T80 bus when I noticed a young man continually moving seats as people shuffled getting on and off the bus. I thought it was strange but I couldn’t figure out what he was doing. Then as my stop was coming up next, I moved over to a seat behind him so I could reach up and press the button without losing my balance. He moved from the seat in front of me and muffled to his friend, ‘I don’t want to die’. Then the light bulb hit. He was distancing himself from anyone that had an Asian appearance. It was 31 January 2020 and this was the day that COVID-19 had a direct impact on me.</p>\n<p>So now it’s week 8 working from home for me. As an avid hiker, I walk 7km each morning to start my day and keep my trail legs moving. Each day the fear I experience on this daily walk is not only about being exposed to the virus, but possibly the racism I may have to endure as well. If there is a person walking towards me, I cross the road to avoid any confrontation about social distancing &#8211; just in case the other person isn’t satisfied with my distancing efforts, which may then lead to some racist remarks. I’m sure some of these people I pass are most relieved as I change directions.</p>\n<p>I should have more faith in people, but the blatant and subtle racism I have experienced throughout my life has taught me that racism will continue to exist, and now the coronavirus fuels racism against Asian-Australians.</p>\n <p>Well what a ride it has been. The shocking realisation that captivity was happening to a resigned acceptance.</p>\n<p>Disciplining myself to exercise at home, focussing on house and work tasks, finishing a scarf started some time ago, actually speaking to friends on the phone _ so retro_ embracing video communication with its chaotic nature, working through a stock of food, once again reloading the dishwasher, grateful that my children are at uni so home schooling is just a terrifying concept, surprised that the days fill up easily, pleased that job tasks are ticked off, excited to be legally invited to dinner as one of two_ told to wear tracksuit as one cannot emerge from this elastic waste, UGG boots cocoon too quickly _ see the emerging light of &#8220;freedom&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Some have have loved this process. Not me, resigned to it yes and completely see the reason why there are positives but look forward to being able to see a great play, have coffee with a friend _ with a renewed appreciation of these gifts and ones like them.</p>\n<p>Sharon</p>\n <p>I wonder why I feel a sense of guilt when I see others suffering, when I am not. It is sometimes hard to to feel or revel in the joy that remains in my world as others are doing it tough.</p>\n <p>I feel like, no matter how much I sleep, I am constantly exhausted and, while I started isolation with so many plans to &#8220;get stuff done&#8221;&#8230; none of it has eventuated.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think that, overall I&#8217;m doing okay. I&#8217;m one of the fortunate ones who is still working, I have family around me, I get out every day for a walk. I&#8217;m (mostly) eating well, trying to not overload on the news and catch up regularly with friends via Zoom and phone calls.</p>\n<p>But a few months before all this my long-term relationship broke down. Then both of my parents became seriously unwell and the pandemic broke.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m just exhausted all the time. Exhausted and worried and tearful. I don&#8217;t seem to have my usual resilience. I drag myself through the day and then the smallest of things sends me into a flood of tears. Or a fury.</p>\n<p>Life just feels so unpredictable and unmanageable.</p>\n <p>I hear so many people talk about anxiety and boredom. Neither of these apply to me. I&#8217;m really enjoying this enforced stay at home period. I&#8217;ve heaps to do.</p>\n<p>Today I didn&#8217;t get up until 8:30, had breakfast and did part of an online drawing workshop on enveloping method of drawing. Then morning tea where we did a couple of crosswords with our coffee and biscuit. After that I went for a walk, just over 5,000 steps. Stopped in at the newsagents at Artarmon and bought a card for our 46th wedding anniversary and a mouse doorstop. That&#8217;s going to be the anniversary present. I&#8217;m planning to paint it before I give it to Peter.</p>\n<p>Got home in time to make sandwiches for lunch, after washing the hands of course. Now I&#8217;ve been catching up with emails. I&#8217;ve started basecoating a little sleigh in red and white which I might give away at Christmas and then I plan to do some embroidery.</p>\n <p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>Life is boring, I have not left home in six weeks and I am bored. But luckily I get to go back to school for a few days a week next week. I still prefer online learning though, I can get everything done in the morning and for the rest of the day, I can sit in a tree and read until the mozzies eat me alive.</p>\n<p>Everyone says this is a once in a 100-year event and I think they are right. 100 years ago we had the Spanish flu take over our lives. Every time someone coughs my younger brother will run to the other end of the house yelling &#8216;Corona.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Life is &#8216;slowly&#8217; turning back to normal ( emphasis on the slowly part ) but it will be a long, dusty road to recovery. Dance helps me take my mind off the things that are happening, I can just dance for ages and not take care of what is happening.</p>\n<p>Cooking helps too, I have decided to attempt to cook a sponge cake in the wood oven, mum says I will fail and so does dad because my grandmother who had the oven before, baked cakes in there that she took to the Sydney Royal Easter Show, but she never once made a successful sponge cake in there. I shall prove them wrong though.</p>\n<p>Well, I must go, it is time for me to do the dreaded task of reading the massive email our principal sent about school.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,<br />\nA . K</p>\n <p>I have been walking 3 times a week with friends, socially distanced of course. It’s very easy to fall into the slump of negative thoughts whilst we are all isolated, but I am constantly reminded of the beauty and colour of our world. Coronavirus can’t take that from us.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, while walking a pathway behind a nursing home and a childcare centre we came across large laminated pictures of flowers. Some were hanging from the fences, some were hanging from the trees, some were tied to the seats along the way. I don’t know who placed them there but it was wonderful to be reminded of the beauty of flowers.</p>\n<p>This morning, another walk, different route. The path took us under a bridge where lots of rocks were placed. Ordinary rocks with extraordinary messages and decorations on them. A magnificently colourful display of painted rocks. Just beautiful.</p>\n<p>So you see, there is still beauty and colour in our world, you can see it when you least expect to. I wonder what I’ll see today.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m frustrated because the corona virus makes it difficult for people to go along and do their own thing at the shops.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s good about it is I don&#8217;t need to do school at school. I can do school at home which is much better and easier because there&#8217;s no rules. Why do you have to do school at school anyway?</p>\n<p>When it&#8217;s over my dad and lovely brother and mum and me will go to Ribs n Burgers all together.</p>\n <p>The End</p>\n<p>What if we were stuck in quarantine forever?<br />\nWhat if we all died and nothing was done?<br />\nWhat if this is the end that many have been dreading?</p>\n<p>These are questions we hate to think about but must eventually.<br />\nWhat will happen?<br />\nBut, we might also live through this. Who knows? We could grow to tell our grandchildren stories of this time or there may not be another generation after.</p>\n<p>Stay positive and stay safe. I know that this entry isn&#8217;t going to help with positivity but oh well.</p>\n <p>(Unrequited) love in the time of covid.</p>\n<p>“I mean, when you like somebody, proximity is a good thing, regardless of how they feel about you. Or don&#8217;t, as the case may be.”<br />\n&#8211; Pacey, Dawson’s Creek</p>\n<p>My affliction is unrequited love. For my manager.</p>\n<p>I have accepted that I may never get over him completely but as with most crippling diseases it comes down to symptom management.</p>\n<p>According to my online research the first step is to “cut off contact” ergo out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>To help get over him I needed to get away from him but the problem was that my job required daily interaction with him.</p>\n<p>The lockdown measures came as an unexpected blessing.</p>\n<p>Admittedly there are downsides to working from home but I am revelling in the upsides. I appreciate not having to wake up to an alarm and not having to navigate public transport. I like dialling in to meetings. I can have a siesta. Most importantly I don’t have to see him.</p>\n<p>I’m no longer distracted by his proximity &#8211; I’m not as anxious or self-conscious or moody. I get more work done.</p>\n<p>It is only under such exceptional circumstances that one who is in enforced confinement can nevertheless feel liberated.</p>\n<p>There is increasing talk of easing restrictions. What does that mean for me and my unfortunate infatuation? I’ll cross the bridge when I get there. In the meantime I’m going to enjoy my sleep ins while I can.</p>\n <p>Coronavirus: Good or Bad?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that Coronavirus is a bad thing. I prefer online learning and doing all my work in bed. (wink, wink). this kind of reminds me of the Black Plague which happened in 1347. There were many deaths and although there was no vaccine created to stop it, the world still went on.</p>\n<p>This gives me hope that even if we don&#8217;t find a vaccine, we can still get through this, together.</p>\n<p>Stay Safe World.</p>\n <p>Where do I start&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, right now things are running wild in my head about how much our world has changed in only a small amount of time.</p>\n<p>Before the spike of the coronavirus hit me and my family were travelling to the other side of Australia, Until we arrived at a small town in SA where our ears were constantly listening to updates on this pandemic. The Borders may be closing, those words changed a very special holiday. The sad thing is we are only making this trip was because my sister lives in WA<br />\nThe next day we packed our stuff up and headed home with a few days with around 6 hour drives until the last stretch with 16 hours of being confined in a car knowing that when i get home i wont even be able to see the ones i miss the most.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t leave unless necessary they said, that was the hardest thing. Being so close to people that bring joy to you but in your mind and reality you can feel their presence. You sit there with levels of boredom going crazy remembering the last times you saw them, heard their voice.</p>\n<p>starting online school, what a pain . Independence is key, but when you sometimes struggle with understanding things like maths, for the first time I said to myself I can&#8217;t wait to go back to school.<br />\nwhile I sit here and type I am looking out my window at the beautiful outside world that used to be filled with so much joy, now you aren&#8217;t always allowed out.</p>\n<p>Though the restrictions are lifting and we are going to school once a week starting next week. its weird to think that getting up was a normal occurrence</p>\n<p>That was Covid19 isolation 2020</p>\n <p>Thursday 7th May</p>\n<p>My dog Bouncer aged 11yr had been sick for a few weeks and had lost a lot of weight. I was monitoring his health but on the morning of Saturday 2nd May he was unable to get down the stairs to the backyard as he always had and I noticed once he settled again he couldn&#8217;t scratch himself and yelped in pain.<br />\nI rang the Great Western Animal Hospital and was told to bring him in. I knew in my heart what the outcome would be and was trying to prepare myself.<br />\nWe were driven there by my son and his girlfriend, with Bouncer and I in the back seat.</p>\n<p>On arrival we had to call reception (Due to Covid 19 restrictions) who advised they would come out to us.</p>\n<p>We sat in the car for over half an hour and it was the sadest but beautiful and funny time. We got to tell him how much we loved him and all the stories of his life. He sat on my lap in the sun, (he loved the sun).</p>\n<p>The Vet called me on my mobile and I was told to drop him off to an assistant at the designated drop off point and they would have a look at him. The assistant took him with such care.</p>\n<p>The Vet called and asked me to come in, I was greeted by the assistant with a face mask.<br />\nI saw him and said &#8220;I&#8217;ve got ya little Bouncey&#8221; The outcome was grim so the hardest decision was made, to put him to sleep.<br />\nTears and mucus all flowing under the mask as I held him until his last heart beat. Bouncer had been through so much in my life but those last moments in the car live forever.</p>\n <p>Is the sky more blue, or is it just me?<br />\nDid I just see a butterfly land in that tree?<br />\nPelican squadrons, no planes overhead!<br />\nNo sounds of traffic to do in my head!<br />\nThe cockatoos are raiding the garden once more.<br />\nAm I noticing more than I have done before?</p>\n<p>Working from home seemed quite awkward at first<br />\nBut I don’t miss the peak-hour trains fit to burst.<br />\nFamily meals at the table, with love prepared,<br />\nConversations that travel to places we daren’t.<br />\nRediscovered embroidery, kits left incomplete,<br />\nBought when children were small, but neglected for sleep.</p>\n<p>We hanker for arts, watch ballet on TV,<br />\nTo go to the theatre, oh when will that be?<br />\nShopping’s now “scavenging”, against everyone.<br />\nChuckling at those on the loo paper run.</p>\n<p>I like my pyjamas – a little too much!<br />\nWho wants to wear makeup, tackle hair with a brush?<br />\nWho knew one’d be hirsute, when no one can see.<br />\nWhen I look in the mirror and discover &#8211; it’s me!</p>\n<p>I peer through my door at the wide world outside,<br />\nSee others go walking, taking bikes for a ride.<br />\nMy beam’s getting broader, I know it is so,<br />\nBut when I tell my feet, “Move!”, they only say, “No!”</p>\n<p>Shall we talk about wine?<br />\nNo. Maybe not.<br />\nLet’s leave that to languish in the land time forgot!</p>\n<p>I now talk to my freezer<br />\nSaying thanks for her work.<br />\nPerhaps that sounds strange…<br />\nAm I going berserk?</p>\n<p>When this madness is over, back to normal’s the thing<br />\nYou’ll find me in a corner<br />\nWith a bottle of gin!</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m feeling OK in the lockdown, I&#8217;m enjoying actually being encouraged to stay inside and read! I&#8217;ve got through so many books and TV series during this time.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working from home for two months and it&#8217;s going OK, I chat with my team on Microsoft Teams all day and we video chat so it doesn&#8217;t really feel that different. I&#8217;m not missing getting up early for my 40-min commute so that will be a shock when we eventually go back to the office, hopefully it will be a phased return. I can&#8217;t imagine going back full-time will be happening anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing is that I&#8217;m from the UK originally and the cases over there are astounding and they aren&#8217;t handling it as well so that makes me worried for my family and friends back home. Flights have been stopped too so if anything happened, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get back.</p>\n <p>God almighty!<br />\nThe world is caving in on itself,<br />\nIn slow motion.</p>\n<p>This viral stampede<br />\nSending us, fleeing like a sea mice,<br />\nBack to our hidey-holes</p>\n<p>This crisis is so terrifying<br />\nThat the men in big suits have seemed to have forgotten the months when the land erupted in flames.</p>\n<p>For this crisis does not care<br />\nFor the digits in your bank account,<br />\nFor your total assets,<br />\nor the GPD.</p>\n<p>And so we cling to each other<br />\nHolding through the distance,<br />\nWatching the death toll rise,<br />\nWatching our pockets run dry,<br />\nWatching the clock,<br />\nWaiting, for a time when we can hold one another again.</p>\n <p>What can I say about Covid-19?</p>\n<p>Firstly, it&#8217;s made all of us hermits. We venue out of the house to the garden and back in again and then repeat the process the next day (it&#8217;s lucky we have a beautiful big yard.) It&#8217;s like Groundhog Day for the most part.</p>\n<p>Home-schooling is a new challenge, especially when balancing working from home at the same time. The kids though, they&#8217;re loving this. Both are on the spectrum and are happy to stay home all the time. In fact, the youngest told his teacher (via Zoom) that he did not miss school and wanted to keep doing school at home forever.</p>\n<p>The only benefit from this whole ordeal is that patisseries are now delivering. I&#8217;m pretty happy about that.</p>\n <p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been around a month since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic and have been in quarantine. I have stayed at home and obeyed all instructions but it has been difficult.</p>\n<p>School is now online and I prefer it this way. I don&#8217;t have to wake up as early to catch the bus honestly, most of the time, schoolwork is accomplished in the comfort of my bed.</p>\n<p>I got bored and I found a new passion; rapping. I love it. So today, I decided to write a rap about Coronavirus.</p>\n<p>This is it:<br />\nCoronavirus, COVID 19<br />\nIt&#8217;s a lean mean killing machine</p>\n<p>They say school might be back,<br />\nI don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad</p>\n<p>All I wanna do is work from bed but the world around me, it&#8217;s all in red.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus Symptoms: headaches and coughs,<br />\nEverybody ending up in hospitals</p>\n<p>The doctors trying to give you masks and supplies<br />\nBut I know that there are some people who sit home and cry.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s always been hatred, now it&#8217;s all love and care<br />\nWe all have something in common, something to share</p>\n<p>But we have our heroes doctors and nurses,<br />\nRisking their lives, they&#8217;re doers, not Sayers.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus has brought us all together, it shows us what really matters.</p>\n<p>Me and my fam in quarantine,<br />\nLiving our best lives if you know what I mean</p>\n<p>We are all in isolation, time for new creations, think outside the box, and heal in your relations.</p>\n<p>Write a story, do a dance, get fit and take a chance.</p>\n<p>Time for humanity to shine, time to say ours, not mine.</p>\n<p>Stop saying why, when and how. God&#8217;s in control, so don&#8217;t worry at all.</p>\n<p>This is a real problem we need to fight it,<br />\nSo let&#8217;s find this cure, United.</p>\n <p>The day I saw the water drops,<br />\nThe friend in my life dropped together.<br />\nThe day I see the flower blooms,<br />\nThe life and the day bloomed together.<br />\nThe day I see a happy starting point,<br />\nThe day end quite bad to me.<br />\nThe day I see the sunshine,<br />\nThe dreamed came true by my day.</p>\n <p>The days stretch on. Clouds inch over the skyline and the trees hardly sway; they are holding their breath. Everybody, everything, is in wait.</p>\n<p>I sit at my window and look. I squint my eyes, focusing in on the horizon, as if concentration itself will transport me to another place &#8211; any other place.</p>\n<p>I wonder what the world thinks. Does it know? When kookaburras cackle, flying over half-empty streets; when the wombats burrow into the soil, seeking refuge from the cold; when the bandicoots search for insects in the middle of the night; when the crickets&#8217; chirp sounds alone; do they know what is happening to us?</p>\n<p>I know one thing for sure &#8211; we have to take something positive from this. When we emerge from our homes, when everyday life returns to us, we cannot allow ourselves to forget what we&#8217;ve learned. How we saw nature begin to replenish in the absence of human interference; how small, common interactions became our lifelines; how our loved ones became even more dear to us. These lessons must settle in our souls.</p>\n<p>I hope essential workers get the recognition they deserve for keeping our society functioning. The teachers, the medical workers, the grocery store employees, the police, the firefighters, right down to the garbage collectors; they all risked their own lives for us. I hope we learn to value each and every member of our workforce.</p>\n<p>Most of all, when we look back on this time, I hope we remember all that we&#8217;ve learnt.</p>\n<p>I hope it changes us.</p>\n <p>I live in Queensland. During the months of the Global Pandemic I have kept watch on the numbers and statistics throughout the World. It has been catastrophic for so many countries.</p>\n<p>We seem very lucky, at this stage, months in, and for now in Australia, holding well on Covid 19. I hear people say &#8220;they expected the worst here, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen!&#8221; My cousin said it to me during a phone call this morning. I don&#8217;t think any of us can say that and be certain. We are on the brink of Winter.</p>\n<p>Weeks and weeks are passing, not working, trying to be very productive at home.<br />\nI have found that, given we can&#8217;t just go and visit and do all the usual things I am more in touch with friends interstate via technology. </p>\n<p>I miss my late parents, but am pleased they didn&#8217;t see 2020 as they were of advanced age and we would not have been able to visit very much at all. We said goodbye to them in 2018 and&#8217;19. I would have loved though, to talk to my father (a WW11 Veteran) about life during The Great Depression. There may be comparisons made later, we will see how everything turns out during the next few years.</p>\n<p>The panic buying was ugly to see. It was a relief for most when the supermarkets started to monitor people and spacing within the store. The ugly side of humanity came first. And then the greatest side of human kindness emerged. It is there to see every day.</p>\n<p>Things I miss: The library, sitting in a cafe, driving a longer distance, the hairdresser!!!</p>\n<p>A time of reflection for me. The World slowed down. There are positives in all of this.<br />\nStay safe.</p>\n <p>Personally, I kind of see Corona Virus as a good thing. For me, I love online school, don&#8217;t need to see anyone I don&#8217;t want to and I have all the free time in the world do whatever I want (whether that is productive or not). Besides with Corona stopping people to go out you can see the world healing. Its already apparent that the world is dying and in a way Corona helped the environment (water is turning blue again and I am sure there is less deforestation occurring). Anyway that is my take on it</p>\n <p>TW: Eating disorders.</p>\n<p>Okay virus, I&#8217;m ready for you to leave now. </p>\n<p>I go back and forth in my head about everything. On the one hand, I feel so thankful that I still have work, but the prospect of traveling on public transport is so anxiety-inducing. I am suddenly very angry at my teenage self for not getting her license- which has never appealed to me, an anxious driver until now. </p>\n<p>I have also left my sharehouse out of fear that I won&#8217;t be able to make rent on my now reduced hours. This has meant moving in with my family, which hasn&#8217;t been easy. My sister has been battling an eating disorder for the past 4 years. She is a beautiful, intelligent, vibrant person, but she can also be very volatile and difficult to live with. I&#8217;m living in my childhood bedroom again and I can hear her eating and purging in the next room. I don&#8217;t know what else to offer her in terms of help. We keep saying to her, that&#8217;s she&#8217;s capable of anything, that she&#8217;s amazing and talented,  but eventually one gets weary from constantly having to say exclusively encouraging things to someone. It is especially hard to be nice to hear at times because she can so often be manipulative and cruel. Though I know this is not intentional it still hurts. </p>\n<p>I am also completing my degree from my bedroom. I am, to be honest, gutted that I&#8217;m spending my final year of university like this. I am struggling to motivate myself and find myself exhausted after hours of zoom classes. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m dreaming of the days were we don&#8217;t bathe in sanitizer, and when I can hug my loved ones again. Soon, it feels near now. </p>\n <p>I never thought that i would be part of a pandemic. I&#8217;ve asked myself what I would do if a deadly virus took over the world, but I always told myself that it would never happen.</p>\n<p>I remember when I first heard about the virus. Four months ago I was sitting in our lounge room watching the news, because they had something about animals on, and just as I was about to change the channel, I heard something that I will never forget. The lady that was reporting had said that a deadly virus was in China. I was terrified, but I didn&#8217;t realize that most of the world would have to self isolate.</p>\n<p>About a month or two after that, social distancing became a thing, and a month or two after that, kids were only allowed to go to school if their parents were medical workers, delivery drivers, grocery store workers, policemen/woman, firemen/woman, or something like that.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t really miss school, but I really miss my friends. I can text and call them, but its not the same.</p>\n<p>A good thing about staying at home is that I can stay in my pj&#8217;s half the day!! I can also spend a lot of my time with my amazing pets!! I can do my school work online while hugging or petting them!!</p>\n<p>I love my teachers, because even though we are living in the middle of a pandemic, they can still teach us many things online.</p>\n<p>The world is suffering right now, but we will get through this together&#8230;</p>\n <p>I actually didn&#8217;t know that this &#8220;Diary Entry&#8221; existed but I love it </p>\n<p>Imagine if the Corona lasted till the last days </p>\n<p>What will you do then?????</p>\n<p>Do we have to live in Isolation forever or will we walk out in the open and be one with nature?????</p>\n<p>Thoughts thoughts thoughts </p>\n<p>I also hope for everyone to be healthy and safe xx</p>\n <p>I wrote a cheesy song, about feeling completely muddled and unmotivated at home but also the comfortability of being in your own space.

Because of this Corona Virus, people need to wash their hands a lot. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll get very very sick &#8211; too sick to go anywhere. If you get even sicker, you might even go to hospital. If they can&#8217;t help you, you&#8217;ll go to the Emergency Hospital. Because of this Corona Virus, loads of things are shut &#8211; like the library, the charity store, the playground, and cafes. When the Corona Virus goes away will you feel happy or angry or confused or cross or sad?</p>\n <p>i don&#8221;t like covid-19!!!!!</p>\n<p>no one does. maybe some children because they don&#8217;t get to go to school, but i miss school. because my friends are there, and so are my teachers.<br />\nSome good things are: i get to play with my six guinea pigs, 🐹, they are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br />\ncute!!<br />\ni also get to play with my 4 chickens and 2 rabbits.</p>\n<p>i get to write to my friends, and see them in their windows, when i drop off their letters, and they don&#8217;t see me!!</p>\n<p>Also a big thank you to my teacher Mrs D for being so organised with all 🏫school work!</p>\n<p>i also get to hold my sisters birds🦜🦜!!</p>\n<p>i can not wait to go back to school😊😊😊😁😁😁😋😎😎!!!</p>\n <p>I was due to travel to Bali and Phuket in March 2020 with my family.</p>\n<p>By February, before the virus was first reported in Australia we were still ready to go and thought we would be safe. </p>\n<p>I kept my eye on Worldometer with no reporting of the virus at our destinations but the again how true was this report?? Then all the flights were cancelled and we started working from HOME – the new NORMAL. </p>\n <p>(Part 1)</p>\n<p>Bette Davis once said “Old age is not for sissies.” I think she was right, but why am I quoting a long gone Hollywood actress? Well I’d tell you if I could remember&#8230;um..er&#8230;Oh I now, remember, it’s about the Queensland Premier. You know her Annabella&#8230;no that’s not it. Annafrieda? No that’s the lovely red-headed girl from ABBA. Remember them? As well as the redhead there was that tall blonde with legs all the way up to her award-winning butt, and the two boys in the background. Whatever happened to them? Well, like all of us they just got old and can’t do all that fancy dancing queen stuff anymore. </p>\n<p>I remember that night in Sydney, eons ago when they were performing outdoors at the sports ground and it rained. Well as it turned out ‘legs’ slipped on the wet floor, fell on that famous butt and bounced back. If that happened today there would be broken hips and slipped discs from here to breakfast time.</p>\n<p>Sorry, I seemed to have shot off on a tangent. What is a tangent? Well I’d look it up for you, but I can’t lift the Macquarie dictionary anymore. It’s too big. I blame the young ones, you know, for making up all these new words and overstuffing the dictionary. Just believe me that it’s something you can shoot off on. Oh bugger, see what I did, I ended a sentence with prepatostrum and I just know I’m going to receive a missive from Rigby. Have I told you about my friend Rigby, he’s really a sweetie, but sees it as his mission in life to correct all my grammar, spelling and punctuation. Now don’t be too harsh on him, after all he is a retired teacher. </p>\n<p>(To be continued)</p>\n <p>I write for a living.</p>\n<p>I am a journalist, and a creative writer, and a library assistant, and even if I weren&#8217;t those things, I&#8217;d still be writing here. </p>\n<p>Some days I cannot get out of bed. I twist and turn between &#8216;it&#8217;s a global pandemic&#8217; and &#8216;why can&#8217;t you be productive?&#8217; until the sky is dark again. </p>\n<p>As I sat by my window last night looking for meteors (and finding none), I wondered what would happen to all the people after this. There is a Great Depression coming, the economists say, but there is also a great depression and loneliness and anxiety seeping into the space where people used to walk and work and live. Today, in the light, I wonder what we will look like when we have finished reshaping and reshuffling into a new normal, a new state of being. </p>\n<p>I write for a living, but sometimes I cannot write about this. </p>\n <p>To my beautiful girl&#8230;</p>\n<p>Today I will pick you up from rehab&#8230;and I am scared, terrified in fact, of what the future will bring. The drugs have stolen your joy, and so they have stolen mine. The pain inside is suffocating..,because I can’t fix you this time, you need to want to fix yourself. I can’t keep you safe, all I can do is love you. And I do.<br />\nBe courageous, be brave&#8230;you are so loved, let this love envelope you, let it carry you and protect you&#8230;<br />\nWhen you feel weak, I will love you even more, hold my hand and we will be brave together.</p>\n<p>Love you always and forever Mum x</p>\n <p>Yesterday was one of the most exciting days we have had since this began as we all went in the car to do a family trip to Costco.</p>\n<p>The kids and I haven’t been in a car for about a month now. It feels ridiculously exciting going in the car, like the way it used to feel before a big plane trip in the Before Times.</p>\n<p>I found a box of plastic gloves and put them on the kids and told them not to touch anything. We went later in the afternoon because I’d read on social media there were less people and you may even find toilet paper.</p>\n<p>We put the kids in a trolley and pushed it up the ramp. You can’t use lifts anymore. They spray disinfectant on the trolleys when you get to the entrance.</p>\n<p>Walking into Costco makes you feel like you are in a different country. One thing that happens when your world shrinks to your apartment and the local shops is that anything outside it becomes unbelievably exciting.</p>\n<p>Wandering round the aisles seeing things from overseas feels like having your senses heightened. You pick things up and really look at them. Then you remember you’re not supposed to touch anything and you drop them quickly. </p>\n<p>Everywhere things are taped off and signs telling you not to touch. There are no free samples anymore. There’s nowhere to sit and eat after. </p>\n<p>Some young people were standing near the blocked off food court  eating from a paper bag. A man in a mask started yelling and told the Costco staff to move them on. They quietly put the bags away and walked back down the ramp. </p>\n<p>That was enough of a taste of freedom for today.</p>\n <p>To Amara</p>\n<p>Well little girl, you’re not so little any more. Soon  you’ll be 14, though already knee-deep in what preoccupies young girls these days. And I hope those are fun times for it’s not fun being anyone in 2020, especially teenagers.</p>\n<p>With luck in 2030, you won’t remember missing your grandparents. You will have forgotten video calls to your cousins (no substitute for their warm embrace). Nor will you remember being denied playgrounds and kiddie rides in malls. But you knew something was up.</p>\n<p>You told us the “comorravirus” could land us in “hostipal”.  You reminded us to wash our hands and use “hanitiser”. I should’ve made hanitiser a trademark and sold it to a loaded pharmaceutical.</p>\n<p>Last Friday though was a welcome break from dreadful enforced isolation.  It was the first time 2 adults and their children could pay a social visit to anyone for a month! </p>\n<p>This week we plan another get-together for Mother’s Day. We have the first shift hosting my parents on Saturday, and then shift them to Pepe’s to celebrate our wonderful mothers apart. But, it’s better than nothing. We adapt.</p>\n<p>But you know what is great right now? Little traffic. Cleaner air. Clear, starry nights. May kindness to the planet continue into the future.</p>\n<p>Work-wise, it’s tricky. I’m still FT but Mum’s hours are reduced. But above all, we’re missing getting together with the greater family, both here and overseas. For now we’re stuck in our little bubble, safe in isolation.<br />\nThings could be worse. So we’re thankful we live where we live, that we’re healthy and happy together.  For the record, we didn’t hoard toilet paper nor flour, or tissues.</p>\n<p>May happy and carefree be each step you take, baby girl.</p>\n<p>Con amor, tu mamá y tu papá!</p>\n <p>I was due to travel to India and Turkey in March 2020 with my husband.</p>\n<p>By February, before the virus was first reported in Australia we were still ready to go since we were travelling independently and thought we would be safe, it seemed that it spread more in groups. I kept my eye on Worldometer with no reporting of the virus at our destinations. I checked the Singapore Airport website, where we would be transiting, it was reassuring about the cleaning regime there.</p>\n<p>However, gradually the news reports became unnerving. Temperature checks were being performed at airports. I thought, what if we just have a temperature due to a cold, would they stop us from travelling further? Will we need to be constantly taking paracetamol to disguise minor temperatures? Then I began thinking, will we need to wear gloves all the time? Masks? They were warning us that the virus remained on the gloves and mask so you had to remove them with care! </p>\n<p>It was all becoming too much. Finally my son&#8217;s workplace was the first city office to be sent home to work due to a possible contact.</p>\n<p>What if we caught it from him and were taken ill overseas?</p>\n<p>It was such a RELIEF making the decision 10 days before departure to cancel the trip regardless of the financial loss. As luck had it we would have departed the day BEFORE the travel ban was enforced. So many Australian travellers were caught overseas as borders closed and curfews enforced.</p>\n<p>I felt so blessed to be safe at home as the horror of the epidemic unfolded so tragically overseas.</p>\n <p>This morning..</p>\n<p>My husband hunched over the table from another sleepless night, I make him another coffee. He is leaving for work, I wake up to face another day of filling the void. </p>\n<p>This pandemic hasn&#8217;t been kind.</p>\n<p>We argue over what I am going to do today, will it be productive? Will I take it easy? Will I find the solution for what we are supposed to do from here? </p>\n<p>I get upset. He gets frustrated. He leaves. I cry.</p>\n <p>This morning it was the supermarket visit. How wonderful to see the shelves filling up again.  There it is the precious yeast that means we can have Pizza again! As much toilet paper as you want. This, after weeks of empty shelves. We are also learning to appreciate what it means to have our bags packed for us and my husband will never be allowed to complain about packers again. Under pressure he mixes fruit with fridge food.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow our dog goes to the groomer so no longer the cuddly teddy bear. She is really very overdue to have her curls shorn but I worry that she will be feeling the cold more now. </p>\n <p>I was so busy yesterday, I almost forgot to breathe. That’s how I would describe the energy needed to be rostered onto a Kindergarten class in a pandemic! The strangeness of teaching in such uncertain times. In conflicting times when we’re told it’s OK, and then it’s not OK, and then it’s OK… to be at school. Kids aren’t carriers. It’s safe. </p>\n<p>Is it OK? Will it be OK?</p>\n<p>Social distancing started as soon as we sat on the floor and ended about a minute later as they crept together, coveting closeness. We started the day with our hand washing routines. </p>\n<p>This will become our normal routine, our everyday routine… even when this ends.</p>\n<p>“Do you sing a song for 20 seconds?” I asked. One girl said she sang happy birthday to her friends, even if it wasn’t their birthday…. And washed her hands. One boy said he just made woop woop sounds…. And washed his hands.We all had a go at wooping. And another girl said she just counts to 20. I said counting to 20 is a great thing to practice. I said I sing if you’re happy and you know it, wash your hands. Twice. Why? One clever girl called out, “because it takes 20 seconds!” Then we all mimed washing our hands. Why did I do this with my fingernails I asked? They all called out, “to get the germs there”. Even in a pandemic we talked about not wasting water, about turning the tap off while we are soaping and singing. Saving water is important, too.</p>\n<p>Then two by two the kids got up and washed their hands. And then we got on with our not so normal day.</p>\n <p>Life in Lockdown</p>\n<p>Caught in a bubble,<br />\nVirus aloft.<br />\nDunking our teabags,<br />\nOh, whoops, I coughed!</p>\n<p>Logon remotely,<br />\nSwitch on your mic.<br />\nVectors we all are,<br />\nPostcodes alike.</p>\n<p>Download the Zoom app,<br />\nSave in the Cloud,<br />\nEmail those clients,<br />\nPJ’s allowed. </p>\n<p>Queuing at Woollies,<br />\nGoop up your hands,<br />\nWipe down the trolley,<br />\nSqueeze past the jams. </p>\n<p>Boredom is boundless,<br />\nEach day a drag.<br />\nHang out that washing!<br />\nDon’t be a nag!</p>\n<p>Netflix works wonders,<br />\nRubbishy shows.<br />\nBrainwaves are slowing,<br />\nNobody knows. </p>\n<p>Finish that novel,<br />\nSet up a blog,<br />\nWork in your garden,<br />\nShampoo the dog. </p>\n<p>Race for a vaccine,<br />\nScientists sweat,<br />\nGlobal pandemic,<br />\nNot quite there yet!</p>\n<p>Sore throats are scary,<br />\nPass me the Vicks,<br />\nShould I get tested?<br />\nNot doin’ it for kicks. </p>\n<p>All of the workers<br />\nOn the frontline,<br />\nYou are the bravest,<br />\nYou’ve got the spine. </p>\n<p>What a vocation<br />\nWhat a great gift,<br />\nWe are indebted,<br />\nShift after shift. </p>\n<p>Summer of bushfires,<br />\nFresh in our minds,<br />\nRebuilding thwarted,<br />\nPayments declined. </p>\n<p>Flora and fauna,<br />\nHabitat gone,<br />\nGene pools receding,<br />\nFlash floods and storms. </p>\n<p>What of the homeless?<br />\nHow do they fare?<br />\nHow can we help them?<br />\nWhy don’t more care? </p>\n<p>Then there’s the women,<br />\nCaught in a trap.<br />\nHusbands that kill them,<br />\nWhy do they snap? </p>\n<p>Sometimes I’m lonely,<br />\nTired of the screen.<br />\nScrolling through Facebook,<br />\nSadness unseen. </p>\n<p>Call up a neighbour,<br />\nGo for a walk,<br />\nDo someone’s shopping,<br />\nJust have a talk. </p>\n<p>When your world’s spinning,<br />\nOut of control,<br />\nTake back your power,<br />\nReach for your goals.</p>\n<p>Let’s make compassion,<br />\nOpen our hearts,<br />\nNation to nation,<br />\nEach play their part. </p>\n<p>One day we’ll look back,<br />\nMemories retained,<br />\nSome things we gave up,<br />\nOh, what we gained. </p>\n <p>It&#8217;s a dentist&#8217;s life in Covid-19</p>\n<p>I managed to sneak<br />\nIn the early weeks<br />\nA needed care<br />\nIn the dentist&#8217;s chair</p>\n<p>Social distancing had begun<br />\nBut some work was won<br />\nAnd with two fillings<br />\nWe squeezed in the &#8216;fun&#8217;</p>\n<p>Lockdown had dawned<br />\nthe streets of people<br />\nwere really quite shorn</p>\n<p>I managed though<br />\nin takeaway throws<br />\nto stand after<br />\nand have a coffee<br />\nwith new smiles on show</p>\n <p>I love film and see many and two never left my mind. The first Outbreak (1995) based on a non-fiction book The HotZone by Richard Preston. The second Contagion (2011) a chilling resemblance to what was to come in 2020.  I had nightmares for weeks after both films and pondered could that happen, knowing fully it could and might, but selfishly NOT in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>Without surprise I recall the first news flash about COVID-19 and positively thought it will be contained like bird flu, or mad cow disease, and it&#8217;s on the other side of the globe, so I&#8217;m safe!</p>\n<p>The second news flash sent a wave of fear over my body.  I felt I was in the movies. It&#8217;s not contained and is spreading exponentially. Hedging my bets, with all manner of PPEs and my will updated I took a last minute bucket list cruise on the QE2 to Tasmania which was wonderful. Returning safely to Sydney, virus free, but straight into self-isolation on Sunday 15th March and there I remained.</p>\n<p>Like many, I gardened and cleaned cupboards. I experimented with unknown recipes and used technology to connect with all whom I hold lovingly in my heart.  The birds still fly and sing, whales swim in the ocean and wildlife return to their natural  habitats. Meteorites fall to earth in rainbow colours and toxic omissions are the lowest they have been for decades. Petrol prices are below the dollar for a litre!</p>\n<p>My feelings now shift to vulnerability and sadness and overwhelming  distrust and disgust.  Who would have said I might have more faith in Hollywood than the institutions of society.  The 7 deadly sins come to mind. Have greed, wrath and sloth overtaken my twilight years? Who holds the cards?  </p>\n<p>See you at the movies.</p>\n <p>I went to the hairdressers on Saturday. After weeks of being with just my husband and daughter and the endless assortment of faces on my laptop screen, it was somewhat strange and over-stimulating to be not just out of the house, but out of the house doing something &#8220;normal&#8221; surrounded by other humans again. </p>\n<p>I spent the first 10-15 minutes excitedly talking &#8220;at&#8221; my stylist, who, judging by her patient but not entirely engaged responses, must be getting people like me in all day every day. In the &#8220;before times&#8221;, I dreaded the inevitable &#8220;So, are you going out tonight?&#8221;  line of questioning, and always had to feign interest in talking about celebrities and reality television. This time however I surprised even myself with my desperate need to talk about nothing and everything to someone, anyone. </p>\n<p>Of course some things never change, and I still left the appointment with a cut I didn&#8217;t particularly like, despite gushing &#8220;Oh I love it!&#8221; as she showed me the back of my head. </p>\n <p>Will anyone ever have Monday-itis again?! This is now the 7th week of &#8216;iso&#8217; at home.</p>\n<p>Working life is a strange blur of remote communication from a singular work station; my colleagues&#8217; faces coming at me in a jumble of video and sound whenever we get together via MSTeams (often with surreal pixelation effects!); and everything now has an email trail! My family and cat are now my real time work mates.</p>\n<p>My husband and I are working from home &#8211; we had to move into our own &#8216;office&#8217; spaces pretty early on due to clashing workplace Teams meetings with blaring out over each other. His office is at the dining table in the family room and mine is at the study desk in the 3rd bedroom. He gets the sun on his back in the morning and I get the sun in my face in the afternoon &#8211; if it&#8217;s sunny. So far the weather has been mostly gorgeous. YAY!</p>\n<p>Our daughter is on leave-without-pay until the end of May. We didn&#8217;t see the sense in her continuing to work at her Randwick childcare centre and coming home to the rest of the family who were in isolation (or socially distanced or whatever). So we are temporarily &#8216;wearing&#8217; the loss of her income.</p>\n<p>Our son is in Year 9 &#8211; so home schooling has been on the agenda as well! As of next week he can go to school on Wednesdays, maintaining social distancing guidelines if possible! He has been pretty good at keeping a regular schedule which includes assigned school work, exercise, reading and music.</p>\n<p>Happy memories from this time?: my son teaching his older sister to play guitar; my daughter reading!!; cooking lessons continue &#8230; I hope the poor cat copes when/if we return to &#8216;normal&#8217; life.  </p>\n <p>Seven weeks in isolation. For me, it hasn’t felt much different, as for the last year, I’ve been in recovery after brain aneurysm surgery and have been isolated anyway. It’s been a year of fearing death, now this!</p>\n<p>When this Pandemic became public, I felt afraid for myself, my family and friends. Thousands were dying across the globe, it felt surreal.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, I had a premonition, that this event was coming. The details included China and the USA as the major players. It was to be a battle like no other to survive. I shudder just how precise my premonition has been.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks of isolation, I couldn’t sleep, had anxiety. I’d meditate, it helped. On difficult nights, I’d call my friend Bonnie in the USA. America was fast becoming a hot spot for the virus and I was very concerned for the safety of my friends there and that this soon, would also be what Australia would be contending with.</p>\n<p>I have only left my home three times all these weeks. I always wear a mask and gloves, but shopping has become too stressful. I used to enjoy shopping, but now I feel afraid of a virus I can’t see and of people being too close to me. Will we ever know normal life again?</p>\n<p>Our numbers have decreased here. The government is reducing safety requirements, but I think it’s too soon. If a second wave comes in winter, we may be hit worse. Our advantage is, we have had preparation time, unlike many other countries. Let’s pray we all get through this!</p>\n<p>Australia is doing well, and I’m grateful we have a government that actually cares about its people. I compare our situation to America and I just thank my lucky stars, I’m Australian!</p>\n <p>Today I had porridge for breakfast (which was very tasty). After breaky I started to get ready for school. I got dressed, cleaned my teeth, brushed my hair, packed my bag, put on my shoes and said goodbye to mum and went to school.</p>\n<p>At school I put my bag on the rack and raced of to see my friends before school starts. When the bell rang I walked to lines ready to start work. After roll call we did spelling and as usual I spelled everything correctly. After spelling we did writing. Than it was time for first break. My friends and I played name tiggy. Than maths was next and I always got correct answers so it was fun.</p>\n<p>At second break we decided to play touch my team won by 4 trys making the sore 7/3. Than we had free time I listened to scratch music and warrior cat rap battles while making a drawing of all my favourite warrior cats. Then it was home time when I got home I got dressed in home cloths and went on the road with my friends. Then it was dinner and I had tasty taco&#8217;s. after dinner I had my shower and then I played some roblox (adopt me). After roblox i went to bed and fell asleep very quickly.</p>\n <p>The waves from the other drivers on the road.<br />\nThe awkward laughs trying to navigate social distancing in the supermarket.<br />\nThe extra phone calls with family and friends.<br />\nThe smiles and nods as we pass one another on the street.<br />\nThe &#8220;in jokes&#8221; about working from home.<br />\nThe genuine &#8220;how are you?&#8221;&#8216;s from strangers.</p>\n<p>See COVID, you may have tipped our world upside down, you may have forced us into isolation.<br />\nBut humanity has never been so connected.<br />\nYou can&#8217;t take our spirit.</p>\n <p>My wife and I are active seniors (both in our seventies) and have been in lockdown for the past few weeks because of the COVID 19 emergency.</p>\n<p>I believe the two things that have helped us are our regular routine including our interests (such as reading, the occasional movie/documentary, keeping up with current events, reaching out to family and friends via social media,regular exercise,sewing) and our vibrant Chriatian faith and service.</p>\n<p>A highlight of each week has been a Zoom meeting with our three adult children in two states and the UK along with their families.</p>\n<p>We have missed corporate worship and service at our local Salvation Army Corps but have been enriched by exercising our faith with daily devotions and live streaming of worship meetings. I have continued leading my weekly Bible Study group via Zoom also.</p>\n<p>Another challenge has been to contact and support my wife&#8217;s parents (both in their nineties and living in their own home) with doing their shopping and keeping in regular contact.</p>\n<p>I am aware that we have weathered this emergency well personally and our country in generally. 2020 has been a tough year for many.</p>\n <p>Stayed up too late.<br />\ntoo late<br />\n2 late<br />\ntutu late<br />\nfor what?</p>\n<p>Late<br />\nlater<br />\nlatest<br />\nthing is non-fiction<br />\nhow many people are infected<br />\nhow many people are out of work<br />\nhow many people are dying<br />\nhealth<br />\neconomy<br />\nthe healtheconomy<br />\nhealth vs economy<br />\nlife and death.<br />\nand</p>\n<p>even the fiction is dark</p>\n<p>dystopia<br />\ndystopian times<br />\ndeath. environmental destruction. zombies. terrorism. pandemic.</p>\n<p>but/and<br />\nthere&#8217;s still music.<br />\nand on the tree outside a banksia cone is opening up so slowly I can&#8217;t see it happening but tomorrow it will be golden.</p>\n <p>On some days you feel aligned with Peace. On some days Peace is so distant, you’ve forgotten what it feels like.<br />\nYou know what it looks like. A loving text. A photo of an old friend. A cherished recipe. A smile. Graffiti. A Japanese garden in the back streets of Tokyo. A spider web. A suitcase in your bedroom. An open bar when you thought everything was closed. Herbs on the kitchen bench.</p>\n<p>Sounds. A voice saying yes. A favourite song. A bird singing. The sound of a parcel being dropped outside your  door. A running creek. The sound of your motorbike starting. The sound of hello. A whispered affirmation. </p>\n<p>When Peace returns you are welcoming. Too welcoming? You are casual. So casual you’ve left notes laying around expressing your love of peace.</p>\n<p>A kiss seems appropriate but your affections are clumsy and you walk with Peace around the house as if to say, “Look, nothing has changed since you were last here.”</p>\n<p>You shower with Peace. You cook dinner with Peace. Obviously a favourite meal that you are confident with, as a token of your appreciation to have such welcome company. You sit for dinner with Peace and break bread. You savour every mouthful and chew slowly because eating with Peace is artistic.</p>\n<p>Late at night in bed you feel the embrace of Peace and her kisses and you would swear that Peace has a perfume. You want to tell her she’s been gone too long and that you nearly forgot what she felt like. You hope to tell her you don’t need her, but you do so you shut up. You hope she never leaves again but you know that she will. You breathe in deeply. You glance through the window and view the stars.</p>\n <p>Staying at home is way overrated.</p>\n<p>The first couple of days are really fun. It&#8217;s a change, you do school at home &#8211; pretty cool right?<br />\nAnd then it isn&#8217;t cool. What can you do on the weekends other than watch Netflix? Is it still fun when the NFL, the Sydney Royal Easter show, and the Olympic games are cancelled? Not really. When I finish all my Netflix shows, what next? You go crazy, confined to your house.</p>\n<p>I try and go out at least once per day. It&#8217;s a relief, being out of the house, breathing in the fresh air.</p>\n <p>The most crazy thing about this experience is the lack of TOILET PAPER. Why toilet paper? I mean, it is a luxury and a good thing to have. But with this fuss, it sometimes seems like the world ends without it. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Social distancing&#8221; is pretty crazy too. You hear stories on the news of police punishing people who don&#8217;t follow social distancing guidelines. The penalties for not social distancing can get as bad as a 16,800 dollar fine or up to 6 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The media coverage on COVID-19 is INSANE. Every night you turn on the news, that&#8217;s all it has. Every time someone dies in Australia, you hear about it on all the news shows. It&#8217;s pretty crazy.</p>\n<p>If one good thing has come from this, everything is being cleaned, and I think that people will become more aware of the spreading of germs in general. It will be a long time though before things go back to normal. There is a start though, and that is people will be doing a staggered return to school and work.</p>\n <p>Hi School,</p>\n<p>I appreciate everything you are trying to do for me but I don&#8217;t think I can do this long-distance relationship anymore. I miss you.</p>\n<p>I admit you drive me crazy sometimes but I have had so many good times with you and I&#8217;m losing my mind without you. The memories, distantly replay in my mind on a repeat of our time together. Do you remember the hours we used to spend with each other? When we learnt from each other?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I am now stuck at home trying to talk to you, tell you I&#8217;m okay but honestly I&#8217;m breaking down. I haven&#8217;t been outside, I haven&#8217;t talked to anyone and I&#8217;m confined to my thoughts. I forever alone without you.</p>\n<p>Let me come see you, I will be good. I&#8217;m sorry about the way I used to behave when we were together, I didn&#8217;t know myself. But know all I what in the world is to see you. You make me a better person.</p>\n<p>Come back to me.</p>\n<p>Sincerely Yours,<br />\nS</p>\n <p>There is so much we don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>Over our history, humanity has learned so much about the world we live in, what we can do in this world and what is beyond our home. Yet we also know nothing. We look to the stars and can only guess what goes on up there, our mind struggles to comprehend the scale and beauty of what we see every night in the sky. We don&#8217;t understand our own minds, how do they work? How do we have a conscience and where does it come from?</p>\n<p>We look to the stars yet we have only explored a small piece of the ocean.</p>\n<p>Humanity looks to the stars and within ourselves in the pursuit of knowledge. We try to find reason and logic in everything we observe when there maybe none. And the fact that we know so little is what drives us to accomplish things that were never considered possible.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know much. But we have the determination and minds to discover more than we now could ever think possible.</p>\n <p>The world around us is crumbling, yet we are only now starting to realise our poor choices.</p>\n<p>Why is it that some ultimatum is leading us to realise this? Why haven&#8217;t we done something already? Are our voices finally going to be heard?</p>\n<p>Time has completely stopped and been altered. It is as if we are just existing not living. Reliving every single passing moment. As if we are in a time capsule watching all of our years surpass us and our thoughts.<br />\nWhat&#8217;s next for us? Do we have a future? How much longer?</p>\n<p>So many questions with little answers. Our educators, politicians, celebrities, people that we look up to are clueless. But us? We have solutions, answers to the most challenging concepts brought about to mankind. But it&#8217;s worthless, that opinion doesn&#8217;t matter.<br />\nHow are we meant to have faith in the world and society around us if it doesn&#8217;t have faith in us, and our answers.</p>\n<p>As the days go by and everyone weakens, I hope and pray this bubble we live in will come to the realisation, that something must be changed. That this was an occurrence that needed to happen in order to open the eyes of the nonchalant society around us.</p>\n <p>Another &#8216;far too early&#8217; waking from yet another restless night. I haven&#8217;t slept properly since I had my heart metaphorically ripped out of my chest. </p>\n<p>Anyways, back to the drawing board. </p>\n<p>I woke up, and as most Gen Y&#8217;s do, I laid in bed for another 30 minutes scrolling through my phone. So healthy, aye? After wasting time, I waddled my way into the kitchen and made some heavenly raisin toast and drowned it in butter (obviously the only way to have it), turned on the Vampire Diaries on my iPad and then begrudgingly made my way to my laptop to begin the day of online learning.</p>\n<p>Period 1 passed like a blur, all of the work completed.<br />\nPeriod 2 was a study period in which I completed some work from my &#8216;usual&#8217; 7:30am class.<br />\nI spent the time allocated for recess outside, stretching on a poofy purple yoga mat.<br />\nComing back inside after getting my absorption of sun, I begun Period 3; in which I had to do this.<br />\nMiraculously as my stomach started growling my dad came home with FOOD! The excitement I felt when I saw the food was indescribable. However a force of ill habit made me feel guilty about eating it &#8211; so afterwards, I drank water. </p>\n<p>Which leads me to now, writing this on this website for school work and waiting for a text message which sees if I get to socialise with non-family members today. (Oh no! Corona! Such a SCANDAL!)</p>\n<p>School also starts Friday next week; something in which I am not overly happy about. *cough* ________________ *cough* thank you for that.</p>\n <p>With the world currently in a state of disaster so am I.  </p>\n<p>I started this whole staying at home thing well, especially since I am not the most social person. Although it may have started out great it has quickly turned me insane. Normal me would go to bed at a decent hour but more recently it has gotten later and later making normal day to day activities harder. </p>\n<p>While it has made me insane, I have become so grateful for the people around us who are trying to save lives. I have become more appreciative of everything my parents and sister do for me after spending all this time with them playing board games and doing puzzles with them. </p>\n <p>I&#8217;ve been existing in a society, the society we live. For, we truly live in a society. </p>\n<p>Business. The business of a society. Or is society the business? Truly, my understand cannot comprehend. </p>\n<p>Society has trapped us. Society sits there, holding us in it&#8217;s palm, and says &#8220;No, this is not you! This is my business! The business of society!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I wonder. And then I remember. </p>\n <p>Welp. I&#8217;m bored</p>\n<p>Stupid corona. I didn&#8217;t mind isolation at the start. Thought it would be fun, being cooped up at home, able to binge watch stuff and play video games all the time. Now, time is non existent for me. I sometimes don&#8217;t even know the day. Everything&#8217;s just a colorless blur. I&#8217;m feeling a little lonely without friends. Family is there but sometimes I want to throttle them, but resist the urge to do so. Hope this will be over.</p>\n<p>Stupid corona</p>\n <p>Corona has taken over the world. It has spread from country to country and is killing so many people. It is all over the news at the moment. Every channel you switch to has information on corona and how to prevent it. I am SO sick of it! </p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t go to school or UNI or work and everything is done at home, on top of everyone you live with! It is especially frustrating when you are driving to the supermarket, watching people, in big groups, not following social distancing! It only takes one of them to have it, spread to the group, those people go home and spread it around to their families! Some people aren&#8217;t so serious about stopping the spread as others are which is really annoying.</p>\n<p>Another crazy thing we just got over is the toilet paper shortage. I am not sure how the whole thing started, but everyone started panic-buying and stocking up on toilet paper! Why? Don&#8217;t ask me. I have one question. WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?! HASN&#8217;T THE WORLD BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH?! Okay, two questions&#8230;</p>\n<p>I wonder if, in the future, something like this will happen again. </p>\n<p>I also wonder how long it will be until corona stops. Hopefully soon. </p>\n<p>If you are reading this in, let&#8217;s say, 100 years, DO NOT think that your lives are harder than ours because, well, really, have you been through 2020? No? Well, then you can&#8217;t say that our lives are easy. They aren&#8217;t. </p>\n <p>The city&#8217;s pulse has slowed.</p>\n<p>The rapid breaths of commuters, traffic, traffic lights, people, things, stuff, have been extended into conscious breathing. The lungs feel clear.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s space in between us.</p>\n<p>Crossing Sydenham Rd is no longer a dance with death.</p>\n<p>Birds have replaced planes.</p>\n<p>Less means more.</p>\n<p>I like it.</p>\n <p>I have been one of the lucky ones &#8211; I am still working as I did before and so have not had the terrible financial worries that many are suffering. I feel bad for all the cafe, restaurant, retail and other workers that I see waiting outside the Centrelink office just around the corner from my place.</p>\n<p>One of the things I have noticed is the sky &#8211; I can see the coast of Newcastle from my balcony, and the sky has gone from choking, smoke-filled haze during the bushfires, to slowly becoming more clear than I have ever seen it. I suppose this is due to the lack of traffic in nearby Sydney as well as some slow down of industry. Even my brief local drives to work have been so much easier, and buses are quicker with less traffic.</p>\n<p>I think about the return of the smog when this is over, and how much attention we will pay to the changes that happened during COVID19 in this way. There also seem to be more of some birds, like crows, in the area, and I have been reading and watching news about the return of wildlife to other parts of the world, including some formerly polluted waterways.</p>\n<p>I wonder how much effort people would be willing to make in order to have this changes be permanent, and how much difference it would make to the world in the long run.</p>\n<p>The pattern of effect of COVID19 seems clear, as I follow the news every day. Countries where people were more looked after prior to the pandemic are coping better. Places where there was less money or disposition to care for all parts of society have fared much worse. This is something I hope will not be lost on us.</p>\n <p>Sundays and Wednesdays</p>\n<p>Since early February I have been at home writing a book. On sabbatical. No overseas travel. No face-to-face conferences. No museum visits. Just at home. The garden is flourishing.</p>\n<p>On Sunday mornings I speak with my daughter who is locked down in her apartment in Manhattan, New York. Cups of tea for me. It’s breakfast time in Sydney. </p>\n<p>Dinner is on the table in New York. </p>\n<p>At 7pm we listen to the sound of New Yorkers cheering and hooting from their windows for the health care workers across the city. It happens every night. We wait. We listen. My son-in-law puts his phone on loudspeaker so I can join in too. </p>\n<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>\n<p>This time is precious. </p>\n<p>On both sides of the world we are tiring of the restrictions. When will it be safe to take up where we left off? It’s a new world.<br />\nMany unknowns.<br />\nTravel.<br />\nWhen will I see those cherished two again face-to-face?<br />\nTalking. Always talking.<br />\nLaughing.<br />\nEating meals together.<br />\nCompleting jigsaws.<br />\nScrabble.<br />\nIt is not the same online. So far away.</p>\n<p>Each Wednesday at lunchtime I visit my son and Millie. She is the new puppy. Dulwich Hill so close to Canterbury. It’s routine now. It’s a routine I love.<br />\nWorking from home. WFH.<br />\nSeeing family face-to-face. Nothing takes its place.</p>\n<p>We walk and buy coffee. The birds are raucous. Nature is cheering.</p>\n<p>Millie joins us – she sniffs each step following her own storybook through the suburb.</p>\n<p>At home with a sandwich, locally made, we want to support our community. </p>\n<p>Making the most of it. We are lucky. Each day. Each moment is precious. It’s a new world. It is not the same online.</p>\n<p>Family.</p>\n<p>I love Sundays and Wednesdays. </p>\n <p>It&#8217;s a glorious Wednesday morning. Does that conjure images of birds chirping, warming sunlight, yellowing lemons, and drying washing?</p>\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s one of those mornings and I&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking &#8216;what was the lockdown for again?&#8217;</p>\n<p>This is my first entry for the State Library, which I discovered only just yesterday. What a great idea! If the Library wants a diary of the absolutely mundane, about boring &amp; warm (but lovely) Autumn days in Sydney whilst in relaxed lockdown restrictions, then it shall have it!</p>\n<p>I have no work to go to, somewhat displaced and living temporarily at my brother and sister in law&#8217;s home. My husband is living at his mother&#8217;s place. Long story there, perhaps another entry&#8230;</p>\n<p>I have attempted to restart studying, through a subsidised TAFE course, but unfortunately my brains are also on a lockdown of their own and refusing to come out no matter what sorts of tricks I&#8217;ve played on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve signed on to so many Streaming subscriptions that I&#8217;ve had to spreadsheet all my logins. Shows I watched/watching/rewatching: The Mandalorian, The Expanse, Killing Eve, NOS4A2, House, Jean Luc Picard<br />\nAs a household, we are competing with each other on the number of cardboard boxes we can collect as a result of online purchasing. I can&#8217;t take anymore bubble wrap. Ideally, we should resell boxes and bubble wrap on ebay. They are fairly pristine.</p>\n<p>Not sure how I got onto this topic but I really love the idea of composting! I have superficially researched this topic and now all I need is: an envirocycle compost bin, kitchen veggie scraps, cuttings from the garden (brown matter) and a home.</p>\n<p>Hey wow, writing this stuff down is awesome! The power of diaries eh?<br />\nBTW, I am getting pretty good at playing Fishdom.</p>\n <p>As retired people aged 70, my husband and I haven’t had to make too many changes to our quiet, measured sort of life. Walking, reading, cooking, the garden, our weekender in the Blue Mountains. This is what we do anyway. We are very lucky. But it’s the difference it’s made to family life that’s significant. </p>\n<p>One daughter is in the UK on a 6-month course, due home August: we don’t know if she will be able to get back then. Another daughter is pregnant, lives not far away, but we haven’t been able to see her and her husband for six weeks. Youngest daughter and family, 10 minutes away, but can’t hug our 2-and 4-year -old grandkids. This seems insignificant compared to many who are really struggling, but it’s the story of many older people at the moment. </p>\n <p>I was sitting on the floor of my bed room cutting the bottom of a t-shirt. I cut the fabric in to strips and tied one end together. then I braided the strips together and tied it shut. i used my handy-dandy red scissors to make the the ends more fluffy like pompoms, and that was my first pet toy that i made for the RSPCA. then I took the top half of the t-shirt and gave it to my sister because, waste is wasteful.</p>\n <p>Ah, waking to the sound of birds singing and that nice feeling of warmth from my silk blankets. Well, I wish that was my morning, what really happens is rather different.</p>\n<p>I wake up to the sound of the garbage truck taking my rubbish and throwing the bin, so that now the bin is on its side. I turn to see the time and realise I slept in&#8230;. like usual. My dog thinks she is a chihuahua when really she is a standard groodle (golden retriever/poodle) and she took half of my bed. </p>\n<p>I decide to get up and put my aqua kettle on to make myself some tea. As I pour the water over my tea bag a waterfall of flavour shouts through my cup. The milk is next and I never know how much to put in, so I am always taste-testing by pouring some out and put more water in or more milk. I grab my phone and walk back into my bed and drink my tea and scroll through my phone. </p>\n<p>As I take my last few sips of my tea, I emerge from my bed and put my clothes on. I pull on my navy shirt and my soft pants. Today was a cold day so I pulled on my socks and jacket and walk into my almost clean bathroom and brush my teeth with my turquoise toothbrush, which is all ruffled. </p>\n<p>Soon after I drag myself into my work space and set of to my work.</p>\n <p>Well, corona, you&#8217;ve been interesting.</p>\n<p>I started a business just before you came ashore, so that&#8217;s been hard. I&#8217;m now competing with so many others to find work.  </p>\n<p>Then, I had to delay my wedding for another year, making sure we can celebrate with our cherished family and friends. (It&#8217;s okay, really, we feel married already &#8211; it&#8217;s everyone else who has struggled with our postponement!) </p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m grateful. I&#8217;m learning to crochet. I look forward to cooking dinner. I&#8217;m walking slowly and seeing more than ever. There are so many books to be read, board games to be played, and deep conversations to share. </p>\n <p>What it would be like to live with corona</p>\n<p>I wake up and I can barely breath. Im 20 and married though no one is next to me or near me. My throat still scratching and throbbing. Im sweating in heat and I have what feels like a migraine. My door opens and one of the doctors comes in with a mask, gloves and what looks like to be a hazmat suit and she hands me a tray with food. I attempt to start eating though I&#8217;m coughing up on my food and I cant even swallow it. I give up on trying to eat and I continue to the shower. I can still barely breath and I have congestion in my nose. I feel completely drained. I get unclothed and ready for my shower. </p>\n<p>Im hot though confused whether to put the water temperature on warm or cool. When I get out of the shower I continue to get dressed. Im still hot and can barely breath. Then they let us out of our rooms for a bit to get some exercise though we still aren&#8217;t allowed to go near anyone. When I exit my room everyone looks at me like I&#8217;m some sort of creature I wish I could explain to them that its just a flu but its really not. It&#8217;s way way way worse than that. All thats playing on my mind is my husband and 2 kids that are left at home 1&#8217;000 kilometres away from me. Every-night I pray to god that I could just see my kids. I only get to call them once a day. </p>\n<p>Fifteen days later and I haven&#8217;t gotten any better. Im 20 young married and so much of my life ahead of me. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t take life for granted&#8230;</p>\n <p>Expecting Social Distancing visitors</p>\n<p>A day of excitement came to our home when two friends said that they would  visit “tomorrow”. “It will be compliant to the “Social Distancing” norms,” </p>\n<p>•\tWe cleaned and disinfected our dusty outdoor table.<br />\n•\tWe  distanced  and disinfected the chairs just in case the virus lurked ready to jump onto our derrieres<br />\n•\tWith all the seriousness of preparing for a Japanese tea making ceremony, I readied the rubber gloves to<br />\n        pick up the tea making paraphernalia.<br />\n•\tI disinfected the outside of the electric kettle, just stopping myself in time from disinfecting its’<br />\n        inside<br />\n•\tThe bathroom got a deep clean. The smell of disinfectant now wafted eye wateringly and reassuringly<br />\n        through the house.<br />\n•\tWe got out our precious liquid gold, the hand sanitiser.<br />\n•\tNow came the really clever part, using rubber gloves I replaced the half used toilet paper roll with a<br />\n        brand new roll. I decided then and there that our guests could take home the leftover roll!  Such toilet<br />\n        paper generosity still fills me with a warm feeling.<br />\n•\tFinally, being super clever, I removed our towels and replaced them with carefully preserved, NOT<br />\n        HOARDED, paper towels.<br />\n•\tBut I forgot to use the rubber gloves! So then, hygienically gloved, I tore off another two lengths<br />\n•\tOH No! I did not disinfect the towel rail!<br />\n•\tThird time lucky! Now the bath room was a total germ free zone</p>\n<p>After instructions to other half –“ON NO ACCOUNT to use the bathroom.” We waited, darkness came, but our guests did not. They did not come until the next day, but they stayed in their car.. Apparently in my excited anticipation of guests, I got the day wrong. Never mind, I still have that roll of toilet paper.</p>\n <p>Part 3</p>\n<p>Our gorgeous &#8220;Lollipop Lady&#8221;, who air-high-fives the kids and shares a fact with them every day. International World Dancing Day saw us shimmy across the pedestrian crossing with smiles and laughs.</p>\n<p>Near enough sometimes is good enough, and even a day of achieving nothing is a day to be proud of. A &#8220;Blanket Day&#8221; means a book was completed. A fresh load of washing is an achievement, fresh sheets, fresh towels, fresh, fresh, fresh. Ignore the &#8220;what you should do is&#8230;&#8221;, no matter how well-intended the sentiment. Trust your instincts and set your own course. Forgive yourself for the days when you felt that you had not accomplished enough. There is nothing to forgive; silence that negative voice. There has always been so much beauty in the world, it is free and sometimes surrounds you when you least expect it and need it most.</p>\n<p>Inhale, exhale, find the joy, raise your voice and be heard. Trust your instincts, form and strengthen bonds. Be brave and be kind.</p>\n <p>Part 2</p>\n<p>Where do I fit into the world? A family of siblings whom I sometimes have to remind that I am of equal value. A mother so vulnerable and dependent, the constant challenge of providing comfort and reassurance in a constantly-changing world of dementia. I have to sometimes tell myself that the best I can do is just that. I am of value and I am good enough.</p>\n<p>To anyone reading this in the future, I hope it is not because you too are navigating a pandemic. But each and every one of us has a talent, perception and that extra iota of strength that they never knew they had. Communities form from a distance sometimes, but communities remain. And in the midst of the worst, there is joy. An ANZAC Day service, three of us in the street with our candles and the minute of silence filled by a chorus of kookaburras which stopped when the minute of silence ended. Glorious sunrises and sunsets, clearer skies because pollution is so much less, beautiful and poignant chalk drawings from a generation of children who probably had to Google &#8220;chalk&#8221; to find out what it is. The power of music, the extraordinary and unique talent of artists that exists in the world.</p>\n <p>Part 1</p>\n<p>Well, week five of my new life. And what have I learnt? I have learnt that the passage of time is both blink of an eye and turn of a cog. That we have control of so little, yet so much. That we have strength we never knew we had, and fear that bounces through our heads at the least expected times.</p>\n<p>I am sixty two years old, and have worked since I was seventeen. I describe my decision to step back from work, due to issues with chronic asthma and bronchitis, as the easiest and hardest decision I have ever made. A decision that I never expected to have to make, but the knowledge that what I chose was the exact and appropriate thing to do. We had formed a tight-knit community of workmates; I miss them terribly but we remain tight; thank goodness for social media and physical distancing but social bonding. I have formed more bonds with my workmates in five weeks than in five years.</p>\n<p>And then the onslaught; hives! On my eyelids, face, scalp, soles of feet, ears&#8230;so ridiculous yet so overwhelming. The next ten days are a blur; a terror-filled trip to the doctor&#8217;s, where I pictured viruses bouncing off the walls, attempts to keep them at bay seemed futile. Sleepless nights, exhaustion and tears but a determination not to give in. Baby steps again, a daily walk, a healthy regime of eating, sewing, reading, writing, anything to continue the attempt to live a positive life. Walking has increased every day; oxygen and calm time to reign in the thoughts bouncing around my head. My mother in aged care; the physical ache that comes from limited visits, limited communication and the heartbreak of physical separation.</p>\n <p>A couple of months ago, my grandmother passed away.</p>\n<p>I remember the day clearly, it was the day before her birthday. I was sitting on my bed writing her card, when my mother walked in, tears streaming down her face as she tried to stay strong for me.</p>\n<p>To this day, I have always wondered how I knew. How without a single word, my mother and I were able to say the unsayable. I remember embracing her in a hug, which she would know is a rare thing for me to do. I had always been a very removed child, constantly avoiding hugs and kisses, feeling claustrophobic if someone managed to strangle me in their embrace. But that day, all I wanted was to hug my mother. I did not cry until she left the room. I never did finish writing that card.</p>\n <p>Dear Dad, </p>\n<p>I’m sorry I can’t visit you. </p>\n<p>I know it&#8217;s been hard for you moving into the nursing home earlier in the year. It’s been a hard transition for both of us. I tried to look after you but we both knew a nursing home was the only option. I&#8217;m sorry Dad.</p>\n<p>But we’d got into a routine hadn&#8217;t we Dad? I was able to work two days per week and visit you on the other days.</p>\n<p>Then came COVID-19. The nursing home made the decision to ban visitors, I know it&#8217;s hard but it was the right thing to do Dad. </p>\n<p>I miss you. I miss our chats, our coffee together, our jokes. I even miss our bickering! Even the crossword gods are against me Dad. Usually, we whip through the Sydney Morning Herald crossword, but I can&#8217;t seem to do it on my own.</p>\n<p>I know you wonder why I&#8217;m not visiting you. Our twice-daily phone calls aren&#8217;t the same are they? </p>\n<p>Time to finish this letter, it’s time to call you. I hope you&#8217;ll be able to help me with 26 down.</p>\n<p>Love<br />\nAlison</p>\n<p>PS I&#8217;ve left you a bottle of whisky at reception, they&#8217;ll bring it up to your room. As you said to me last night, &#8216;I&#8217;m 93, and my nightly whisky keeps me going.&#8217; Good for you Dad, have to keep the spirits up! </p>\n <p>What strange times we live in. I wish I would wake up and realise it was only a bad dream. </p>\n<p>I keep wondering how we arrived at this point of total upheaval, and in the blink of an eye. Had a gigantic meteor unexpectedly collided with our planet, sure. But this?</p>\n<p>My overwhelming feelings are frustration, disappointment, sadness, anger. But not fear. Not one little bit.</p>\n<p>No, I’m never going to allow them to inject me with fear. I know that’s what they want. That’s how they make us compliant. </p>\n<p>Who’s ‘they’? Our untrustworthy careerist politicians, no matter which shade of grey; our opportunistic so-called experts; our hopelessly failing mainstream media. </p>\n<p>I will not fall for their insane, irrational narrative. I will not be locked into their edificies of lies, distractions, and misinformation. I will not be drowned by endless waves of hysteria. </p>\n<p>I’m not a sheep, I’m a citizen. As such I will keep asking questions. I can think for myself. </p>\n<p>As citizens our duty is to think, to care, to be engaged, to hold to account about vital issues. So I speak out, on my website, on social media. I encourage others to think for themselves and look beyond the blatant propaganda.</p>\n<p>However, it appears the lights have gone out, at least here in Australia. Democracy, freedom and civil rights, with all their pre-existing ailments, are now on life support. There won’t be respirators for them. And they, they will just switch off the machine, cheered on by 25 million voiceless voices singing the requiem “&#8230;advance Australia, where?”</p>\n<p>For me the biggest question of all is: why does nobody else ask the hard questions? Can really nobody else see and hear what I’m seeing and hearing all around the world? </p>\n<p>So yes, there’s a sense of loneliness too. </p>\n <p>Wake Up</p>\n<p>Hey Carona making us wake up<br />\nSo we can see<br />\nOut of this sleepy slumber<br />\nYou and me<br />\nWhat’s important, what’s true?<br />\nOr do you still not have a clue?<br />\nDo you really care for others’ health?<br />\nOr do you care only for your own wealth?<br />\nThis disease chooses anyone &#8211; rich or poor<br />\nEveryone is equal under Carona law<br />\nSome are now listening, a new way of being<br />\nIt’s taken Carona for us to be seeing</p>\n <p>Even though my &#8220;old&#8221; life was hectic, I think it got busier after I retired 3 years ago, I&#8217;ve realised how much I loved doing all those things, sometimes I would think that I would like more time to read or do more music practice but now that I have all this time I&#8217;ve realised that I actually was doing exactly what I wanted to do. </p>\n<p>The things I miss most are the activities where I was helping people and making a difference &#8211; learn &#8211; to &#8211; swim teaching, working in Vinnies, being involved in Rotary projects, I feel a bit of a bludger at the moment.</p>\n <p>I  haven&#8217;t left the house in days. People I now have gotten sick and I am in hospital as I  write this. </p>\n<p>I walk around the streets, everybody&#8217;s heads are down, face hidden by a mask, trying to protect themselves from the virus. It sits there lurking in the dark looking for the weak before breaking into your immune system sending pains like sharp knives into your lungs. It is no longer safe outside no matter if you&#8217;re rich or poor, the virus does not discriminate. </p>\n<p>All shops are closing, putting us in place for a recession. Crime will go up and yet again I  will no longer be able to go outside. </p>\n<p>I  miss friends. I  miss family. I  miss my life.  </p>\n <p>Captains Log Day 2 Week 9 of the Corona files:</p>\n<p>Today I took my log cutting chainsaw on the road and went on a space walk around the Isolation Pod. Yes! Chainsaw in hand, I looked for an ideal spot to chop up some timber for the self contained BBQ in the entertaining area out the back of the Isolation Pod. My thinking being that with some of the COVID restrictions eased the next weekend might be a good opportunity to burn meat into a carcinogenic state with friends (all 2 of them) and tempt fate even more than the virus has. Ahhh! the small pleasures that are making isolation tolerable.</p>\n<p>Today I am looking forward to having some more English Muffins for lunch. Yes! that&#8217;s the high point of the day. As time continues to drag on, its a bit like being forced to binge watch a TV Soap like &#8220;Neighbors&#8221; or a reality TV Show like &#8220;My Kitchen Makes Me Fat&#8221; (joking aside the would be a good title for a COVID based TV Show.)</p>\n<p>Oh dear! I cannot believe that it has been more than 2 months now in this Isolation Pod out in the Werrington Sector &#8230;&#8230;. BTW &#8211; Apparently, there is now talk of a &#8220;NZ Bubble&#8221;, interesting idea yes, but more jargon to add to things like &#8220;social distancing&#8221;, &#8220;flattening the curve&#8221; and &#8220;avoiding the peak&#8221; &#8211; room for a COVID-19 Dictionary I&#8217;d say, but I&#8217;ll leave that for my next entry?</p>\n <p>Ever since quarantine I&#8217;ve slipped back into a nocturnal schedule. Wake at 4pm and sleep at 4pm. The anxiety about the future is what mostly keeps me up at night.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m supposed to graduate in a term and job opportunities seem to be absymal. I&#8217;m scared of not being able to get into a related industry to my degree and derailing my career progression for a couple years. I&#8217;m so anxious I can&#8217;t even begin to look for jobs.</p>\n<p>Many of my friends have fallen back into their depression and being forced to distance yourself from friends and family isn&#8217;t helping either. It turns out mindset from living back to just surving and it is largely damaging.</p>\n<p>My family knew of this virus from the early days. Monitored it since early Jan and we knew with sinking hearts that western countries would be hit the hardest as they had no culture of wearing masks. In fact they discriminated against those who did, against those who were trying to protect themselves and those around them. They were abused over and over all around the world and it forced us to remember that racism wasn&#8217;t &#8216;better&#8217; in our age. It was just hidden better. It forced us to remember that our normalcy of before was a pile of cards waiting to collapse and the virus exposed all society&#8217;s flaws.</p>\n<p>And yet I can&#8217;t help thinking I wish things all returned to normal.</p>\n <p>First time hearing about this in February hoped it wouldn’t be a big deal like most other virus scares. March 12th was the day the world started taking it a bit more seriously. Online on social media it became a bit more prevalent that it wasn’t just going to be contained in China. March felt very long getting used to social distancing and not going out much. April felt quicker. Mostly due to sleeping in. Unsure if I want to extend my course at uni like I planned. A main reason for extending was for the social aspects which now would just be online. Everyone’s been cooking a lot or atleast tried.</p>\n<p>Yeast, eggs and flour have been sold out since March- just starting to see some stores have a bit of stock. A lot of contradicting reports, depends where you look, on the severity of the virus months in and still not all that much is known. USA almost halfed the original death toll a few days ago. A lot of “boomers” seek to a certain messaging app where rumoured remedies are shared such as cut onions at all corners of the room or on the feet, Boiling orange peels and spices.</p>\n<p>A lot of memes have arised about that. Meme humour is getting a little weirder. Not a lot of outside sources to create the memes so people resort to pretty dumb and pointless ones but somehow they are hilarious. This has no structure I’m really just writing anything I can think of that would be interesting lol.</p>\n <p>It’s not often in life that you are completely untethered.</p>\n<p>My job is stressful, but for no real reason. I’m good at it and I find it easy but everything feels completely pointless.</p>\n<p>I’m slowly losing my grip on things, I guess, my nice orderly life has taken a somewhat jarring turn for the completely unexpected.</p>\n<p>I have no way to cope. I usually go to the gym or go outside for a walk or go be somewhere by myself but that’s not an option these days. It feels so pathetic when I say it like that, there are plenty more people worse off than I am. But I can’t help but wonder how long I can hold on.</p>\n<p>My dreams are so much more vivid now. I am remembering things I’d rather not. Is this COVID-19 or is this me failing to cope with adversity? Does anyone else feel this way?</p>\n<p>I’ve had to stop reading the news.</p>\n<p>My family is overseas in a badly affected country. I worry about them constantly. I want this all to stop. I need to find someone who understands but I’m afraid to ask. I’m afraid to tell someone how I’m feeling.</p>\n<p>I’m afraid.</p>\n <p>Today I was keen for some good fish and chips. The Sydney Cove Oyster Bar was serving take away, including fish and chips, at a good price on the weekend, but unfortunately today it was a no go. They weren&#8217;t open.<br />\nAt least I got my exercise in nice weather. It&#8217;s nice to have some Vitamin D when you go outside for some say exercise or essentials.</p>\n<p>I managed a non prepared for home lunch with another take away. Chicken schnitzel and chips also at a good price. Eating seems to become a priority during Covid-19. I haven&#8217;t sufferred from snacking as a lot have said they are sufferring from. It&#8217;s just that home cooking means you have an eye on the next day if not weeks ahead rather than taking it as it comes. No, I&#8217;ve seen a lady on TV preparing frozen meals, some 50 or so, for $120. But I haven&#8217;t been like that&#8230;ever!</p>\n<p>Yes, I miss the option of eating out. Even in the CBD, the take away option has become restricted. At least I had some hot chips at last!</p>\n <p>Four weeks of almost no interaction with grandkids has resulted in a great evolution in my garden but I can&#8217;t wait to be back blowing bubbles and finger painting again!</p>\n <p>2020<br />\nWhat a year so far<br />\nStarts so normal<br />\nThen turns bizarre</p>\n<p>At 1st, you ask<br />\nJust how bad could this get?<br />\nWho&#8217;s gonna call an apocalyptic bet.</p>\n<p>Apocalyptic, you say?<br />\nSurely you jest.<br />\nHuh uh! No way.<br />\nWe&#8217;re in for a test.</p>\n<p>Time to stand up, and see who you are.<br />\nSelfish or selful<br />\nOr or just plain bizarre?</p>\n <p>The world is still spinning, the virus keeps spreading. We unite by standing still</p>\n<p>Day comes night and night comes day. Rise, the sun will keep shining</p>\n <p>It started as normal work day with the Virus taking control of our lives. My work continued as a front line officer. About 10.30am I received a call from my wife. She was distressed, her mother, in a nursing home had turned for the worst. I left immediately picked up our son and make the drive to her.</p>\n<p>On arrival we were met by staff and informed that we were to late she had passed. We had a temperatures take PPE given to wear and entered her home of three years to say goodbye. A woman of 93 years, exceptional person, order of Spain recipient her name Concha Trivin. She cam from Pain in 1961. Learnt the language, loved life and loved her new country. Married Gus, and adopted their only child Ana Marie. </p>\n<p>They lived in the city and remained there until they brought into the Suburbs, Ashfield NSW to retire. Gus passed in 2002. Concha remained in Ashfield until 2017, were age and care that was needed moved her to her last home at the only Spanish Nursing Home. She received the award for contribution to the Spanish community with Australia, she worked tirelessly to help others.</p>\n<p>A woman who gave so much to so many got a respected send off with only 10 people allowed to attend. She was robbed on the many family, friends who would have attended to bid her a fond and respectful farewell. A strict Catholic who attended mass every day until she went to a home was given a full catholic send off. The virus that generations will read about in the future, not only affected everyday life for everyone, they robbed many of the dignified send off they deserved. A terrible hard year for all.</p>\n <p>I am one of the lucky ones. My life hasn&#8217;t changed much since a pandemic took over the world. I still have a job. I still work full time. A homebody with no real friendship group to speak of, the loss of socialising hasn&#8217;t affected me that much.</p>\n<p>Of course things are different. I do miss my family. Board game nights with my brothers. Date nights with my fiancee. These days the only place I go other than work is the supermarket, and if I didn&#8217;t like grocery shopping before this, I certainly don&#8217;t like it any more now. This panic buying and hoarding is just pathetic. We&#8217;re all scared, but hundreds of rolls of toilet paper, packets of spaghetti and liters of hand soap is not the answer. There has always been more than enough for everyone, but some choose to be selfish and the rest go without.</p>\n<p>Having turned 30 at the beginning of the year I didn&#8217;t know how the start of my third decade alive would go; I certainly didn&#8217;t anticipate this. Perhaps my fiancee and I would finally get married, we&#8217;d sell our place and move somewhere bigger, maybe take our first overseas trip together (her first time overseas). But instead we got COVID-19.</p>\n<p>And while I have the greatest respect for healthcare workers, emergency personnel, supermarket employees, anyone on the front line, all of whom I cannot thank enough; this pandemic has proven one thing. People are selfish, and Australian &#8220;mateship&#8221; is a myth. People are looking out for themselves. Grabbing as much as they can, everyone else be damned. People are having parties, whinging about being put up in 5-star hotels, while the vulnerable are dying and the true superheroes are risking their lives so you can live another day.</p>\n <p>These are some of the verses of a poem I wrote. Sadly its too long to include it all here so I hope to be able to include the whole piece for you somehow.

I would like a Japanese garden. I am drinking a cup of Chai.<br />\nEarlier, I took a hot-cross bun from the freezer<br />\nand toasted it. There are roasted vegetables in the fridge, left over from Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>I contemplate COVID. I touch my face.<br />\nI need a shave. The rain fall becomes heavier.<br />\nI put on a jumper and start writing.<br />\nIn the late afternoon I water indoor plants and go through a box of old photos.</p>\n<p>Later, I shave and then drive into town to shop, have coffee and<br />\nto buy fish and chips. It is still raining.<br />\nBack home I unwrap my chow<br />\non the kitchen bench and add lemon and salt and cut bread. I am dressed well. So well I would feel comfortable going to a movie premiere in this garb tonight.<br />\nBut I won’t be doing that.<br />\nI grab napkins and turn on the heater. I turn on Spotify. Pieces of a Dream. The sun comes out in time for a sunset.<br />\nwww.thelastpostmagazine.com</p>\n <p>We arrive just before 3:30. A notice on the door says &#8220;due to the COVID-19 outbreak only two patients are allowed in the surgery. Please knock and wait for the receptionist.&#8221; I knock, and we wait.</p>\n<p>Anna, the receptionist, opens the door. She is wearing PPE and holding an infrared thermometer. She asks us to stand well apart on opposite sides of the room where she takes our temperatures. We all sterilise our hands.</p>\n<p>T goes in to get his flu jab. I reflect on how quiet it is. Doctor Patricia is an Uruguayan who serves the large Spanish and Portuguese population in our area. Her surgery is usually busy, with up to eight &#8211; typically elderly &#8211; patients packed in the tiny waiting room. Today it&#8217;s just me.</p>\n<p>I ask Anna if they&#8217;re busy. Not really, she says. Everyone is keeping away for fear of contracting COVID-19 from the surgery, despite the rigorous cleaning routine. They can&#8217;t be too careful; both Patricia and Anna are around my age, late fifties, not high-risk age-wise, but certainly at risk of repeated exposure to the virus.</p>\n<p>T thanks Patricia and Anna for &#8220;being in the front line and looking out for us&#8221;. Patricia&#8217;s eyes light up, and I can tell she is beaming under her face-mask. Anna looks embarrassed, mutters &#8216;de nada&#8217; and waves his thanks away, but she also looks pleased.</p>\n<p>Anna leads the way to the door, unlocks it, and stands on the footpath, allowing us to leave. An older couple is waiting to come in; Anna asks them to stand back so we can go. I smile at the couple; they smile back. We say our goodbyes and walk back to the car while the couple enter the surgery with Anna waiting with her PPE and infrared thermometer.</p>\n <p>My husband and I are very grateful to be well and living in Australia, given the high death rates from covid-19 in other countries.  We are concerned for the ongoing economic impact on the economy and the many young people who will be traumatically affected for years to come. Throughout our lives, when testing times came, they were largely personal, and we eventually learned that good results can come out of traumatic situations. I guess that is what teaches you resilience and gives you emotional capital.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing for us has been not being able to physically see our grandchildren.  Luckily my husband has an Apple iphone and we were able to use facetime as a proxy.  </p>\n<p>Personally I was very disturbed that having come out of a bushfire crisis that seemed to bring out the best in Australians we plunged straight into the toilet paper hoarding episode which clearly demonstrated the opposite.  Also the concept of &#8220;community&#8221; was tested when it was obvious that neighbours were not adhering to the government regulations regarding number of visitors. While we were social distancing for the greater public good, other people do not appear to understand that particular concept.</p>\n<p>I have found the ABC News 24 11am programme a very professional coverage of the pandemic. I am concerned that older Australians will not have access to the covid-safe technology because they do not have the appropriate phones.</p>\n<p>I walk every day and my husband has been able to continue to play golf (with one week vetoed) and so our physical exercise has been ongoing.  I have found the birdsong more prominent and the news that the snow on the Himalayas have been visible from parts of India for the first time in years was so pleasing. Perhaps politicians can note this.</p>\n <p>I am relieved that I have a chance to slow down and reassess my priorities. I didn&#8217;t realise I was going through life on autopilot.</p>\n<p>I walk along the coastline almost every day and cook slowly like my grandparents used to. </p>\n<p>I am grateful that I have a stable and rewarding job at a time of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>I miss laughing with my friends at the pub.</p>\n<p>I drink too much now on weeknights because I feel unsettled.</p>\n<p>I am exhausted by being compelled to be on screens all day for work and now for social interaction. It&#8217;s not an adequate alternative for real life. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to find a way to acknowledge all those poor people who are  sick or passed away without getting sucked into a dark place.</p>\n<p>I guess this is a lesson about balance. </p>\n <p>This whole period hasn&#8217;t changed my day to day in that I am fortunate to have a With regard to the Hibernation period. I think there are two aspects to it, Finding things you enjoy doing (or simply being) and Staying Emotionally positive. </p>\n<p>1. Meditate every morning for 10 minutes. </p>\n<p>2.Write a to do list for each day and 5 things I am grateful for</p>\n<p>3. Focus on making sure other people are ok it takes the focus off self: try and contact someone every day that I know. Plus I ring my mum daily and have a long video call with her. She lives on her own and thrives on people contact. She has just put her partner in a home and they won’t let her see him. I know apart from her zoom guitar and yoga lessons she is lonely.  So I know that this helps her to speak with someone. Zoom calls Or house party are a great way to get together and catch up as a group. I make craft videos for the grand children and message it to them so it continues what we used to do here. I am doing a painting lesson for Kym Ellery on Friday night. She is locked down in Paris so I thought it would be fun. I have seen people start virtual book clubs.</p>\n<p>4. I minimise watching the news! I watch things that make me reflect or make me happy.<br />\nI have also revisited Dijon through my drawings in a small book as I was meant to be there right now. </p>\n <p>3.5 million cases. 250 thousand deaths. What could I possibly be talking about? None other than the infamous Coronavirus.</p>\n<p>COVID19 to the officials; corona to the kids. I am a self-proclaimed corona-kid. Perhaps babies born in this time are more accurately corona-kids than me but growing up in these trying times is just as bad.</p>\n<p>I saw a couple of articles about coronavirus in early 2020. I suspected it was one of those obscure viruses that don&#8217;t really kill anyone and you don&#8217;t really hear about. I was definitively wrong.</p>\n<p>My mum thinks that coronavirus is the first time the whole world has been united against a common enemy. She&#8217;s right. We are all fighting the same battle against the same enemy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not at school. I&#8217;m remote learning. It&#8217;s okay and I like not having to get up early, but sometimes it&#8217;s hard to focus on the task at hand.</p>\n<p>Everything on the news is about coronavirus. Whilst not always directly, it can be talked about when talking about the impacts. I haven&#8217;t seen my friends in person since March 22nd. It is now May 5th. It has been 44 days.</p>\n<p>They say that it&#8217;s okay to miss out on a week of school here and a week of school there when you are in Year 4, or Year 7, but as a Kindergartner or a Year 12 student it must be really hard. I am in year 7 and I guess they&#8217;re right. Missing school in Year 7 wouldn&#8217;t be critical. For my brother in Year 12, it&#8217;s hard.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we are going back to school soon for 2 days a week, and then 3.</p>\n<p>Enough about coronavirus. I had a bagel with cream cheese on it today and it was yummy. Thank you for listening to me.</p>\n <p>I have been stuck in the house for weeks upon end,<br />\nnot seeing anyone in person is annoying.<br />\nThe only way I can interact is by a device. It is not<br />\nthe same as seeing people in person.</p>\n<p>The first time I heard of coronavirus I thought it was like the cold but it has turned out to be heaps worse. I hope we can return to school soon and see our friends and family.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m a student studying at home.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been out the house for weeks now. I have only seen my friends through the lifeless screens of my laptop and phone. I thought online learning would be easy but it is really hard to stay focused at home.</p>\n<p>I first heard of corona virus through the Tik Tok app. I thought it was a phase and it would go away. I never would have thought it would come to this.</p>\n <p>A moment in bliss</p>\n<p>The air is so clean. Visibility is to the distant horizon. Never have I seen so far towards the beaches of Newcastle, or such detail of the trees and rocks of the Broken back range yonder. Will I see again in this life time, the beauty of nature in such crystal clarity?</p>\n<p>I have had the rare privilege of glimpsing a heavenly paradise that hitherto was veiled with pollution, politics, greed, fear and consumption. A deadly virus and the human hyper reaction brought about this momentary transformation.</p>\n<p>Will we learn from this event and change our ways of avidya to vidya before it is all too late? Will we understand the wisdom of Carl Sagan’s ‘Pale Blue Dot’? Will we return to the old ways and veil it all again? </p>\n<p>Will I be among the last of my kind to have glimpsed this heavenly paradise in all its clarity, beauty and worth?</p>\n <p>So grateful to still have work, but oh so concerned for all those who have lost their job, or their business during this pandemic.  I am much more conscious of ‘buying local’ to support my local community, and buying Australian made products.  </p>\n<p>Dad has dementia. We struggled through 7 weeks of no visits. Talking on the phone or via Skype is challenging, as he puts the phone down to go looking for me.  The nursing home granted a compassionate visit a week ago, and Dad’s face lit up with recognition and joy when he saw me.   </p>\n<p>My Zumba teacher created online classes &#8211; oh, how I need this! I can exercise for a bit, have a break, speed it up, slow it down &#8211; all in the comfort of my lounge room.  Being adaptable and innovative is definitely a key for small businesses to survive. </p>\n<p>  Wednesday night trivia;<br />\n  Friday drinks at the pub;<br />\n  weekend coffee with friends;<br />\n  morning tea on Sunday with Mum;<br />\n&#8230;all banned.  </p>\n<p>Instead, each day, I record the number of cases, deaths and recoveries, for Australia and the world overall, in a book.  Once a week, I record statistics for the 20 worst affected countries. I find it interesting to see the countries move position on the ladder. It makes me question &#8211;  Why are the case numbers so high and the number of deaths so low there? Why so many deaths here? Inconsistencies in testing rates and reporting methods is generally the answer. Along with relaxed or delayed enforcement of restrictions or lockdowns.<br />\nI like to think that one day, my future grandchildren (🤞) will flick through these pages, reading my notes.</p>\n<p>I feel blessed that none of my family, friends, or colleagues have contracted the virus. But all of us have been impacted by it.</p>\n <p>Today I woke up later than usual. The cold weather has arrived and it seems like it is here to stay. My husband cooked breakfast for my daughter and I. We went to our backyard deck and watched the birds have a real party. Their noise was so loud, we live by the Bidjigal reserve in West Pennant hills and it is magical here. Lots of cockatoos, magpies, kookaburras, you name it. They are so loud in the mornings, this morning they were even louder. After this, my 3 yo daughter made soup out of pieces of plants she has collected in the bush land. She loves picking flowers, seeds and everything else. She made me a lovely “soup” and we pretended to eat it together.

The hoarding has been amazing and I have not been able to make sense of it.</p>\n<p>For myself, life hasn&#8217;t changed too much and I am truly grateful. I am not in isolation, I am still working full time with a wonderful team of nurses. Sure I am grieving the inability to see my 4 children, my 3 grandchildren and I am not, by choice, seeing my partner as he is classified as high risk. It has been lonely, but I am one of the lucky ones&#8230;I still have work and everything that security brings&#8230;so do my children and their partners&#8230;.and access to technology to keep us in touch.</p>\n<p>I am not on the frontline as such but still am part of an essential service responsible for the support of women and their families following birth of their babies. Babies don&#8217;t stop being born because of a pandemic. Providing support during this intimate and special time via telehealth has it&#8217;s challenges&#8230;Trying to socially distance and only being able to spend 15 minutes in close contact either during home visits or in clinic appointments and virtual parenting groups has been a huge change in practice for the child and family health nurses and they have embraced it well.</p>\n<p>We have seen an increase in postnatal depression, and sadly Domestic Violence. Our service has changed&#8230;our lives have changed..but we will come through this and hopefully for the better.</p>\n <p>Being 15 (almost 16) this year has been one of which I&#8217;m almost certain I won&#8217;t forget already! I remember sitting on a bus in February and wondering if this new thing, Corona Virus will end up having an impact here in Australia. Well it sure did, for me coming into 2020 I wanted to get my first proper job (which is virtually impossible now), travel before year 11 (also impossible) and to do well in school.</p>\n<p>School is definitely different, online learning has definitely taken over. I am lucky enough to go to a private school and most of our classes happen over Zoom, on Zoom you are able to interact with your class and teacher online within a meeting. As for private music lessons they too happen online, although it can be quite difficult at times and with sport you can basically only do fitness. </p>\n<p>As much as it seems like this time would be a nice break from day to day life, sadness seems to fill this time more than anything else for many. I personally feel very lucky for my family to be safe and to live in this country during these times, rather than the US or Italy. However I feel as though my grandparents are feeling rather lonely and understandably so. Mental health is having an profound effect on so many.</p>\n<p>I believe that this pandemic will forever change my generation. Just enjoying the little things will most likely be our motto. I honestly can&#8217;t wait to just go to the beach or shopping again with my friends (as much as I love watching TikToks and writing random songs in my room). I know &#8216;normal&#8217; will look a lot different moving forward but I can&#8217;t wait for it regardless.</p>\n <p>2020 &#8211; The year that humans took an enforced step back and Mother Nature took a breath and enjoyed a renewed freedom. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year schools became ghosts of their vibrant past.</p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year where children were required to learn in a new format in the space of 24 hours.</p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year students would rather be at school than at home. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year that tears flowed when children were told it would be another week learning away from their classroom and friends.  </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year where teachers were equally put down and flooded with gratitude. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year teachers all over world worried more then ever about their students. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year my heart ached and my eyes wept for those students whose safe place is the four walls of my (our) classroom. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year i missed my students and our daily chats about little nothings and big somethings. </p>\n<p>2020 &#8211; The year we would all like to make it through, healthy and safe. </p>\n <p>I’m 73 years old and I have rheumatoid arthritis and my treatment includes immuno suppressing drugs. This treatment leaves me very vulnerable to infections, virus and sickness. </p>\n<p>As a result my family have wrapped me in cotton wool and shipped me off to a family beach house where I’ve resided since the last week of February. </p>\n<p>I’ve had little contact outside of immediate family but have learned new skills with digital platforms including ZOOM and FaceTime which have allowed me to keep in touch with friends and more distant relatives. I even have a drink with friends a couple of times a week via FaceTime- at least some level of social contact. </p>\n<p>In some ways the lockdown has been good &#8211; I’ve spent more time with some of my grandchildren that I’d normally be able to do, and I’ve saved lots of money normally spent on entertainment and restaurant dining. </p>\n<p>I’m missing dining out and I’m missing golf and travel. My wife and I have cancelled a couple of overseas trips and a couple of domestic trips. We hope that we can get back to travel soon. </p>\n <p>How long has it been since I&#8217;ve been to work?</p>\n<p>I lost count after week 2, the only thing that&#8217;s keeping me aware of the days, are those Instagram games where you pick a song for each day for 30 days.</p>\n<p>30th day is tomorrow. I wonder what I could do after that?</p>\n<p>I thought isolation would bring throw me in a spiral, but it&#8217;s actually done wonders.<br />\nBeing at home grants me time to do things I never had the time to do.<br />\nFully clean the house, listen to new music, read, even shave my head!<br />\nI took up art again, stopped writing for a bit, finally gave my dog a bath but he still needs to visit pet barn soon.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t miss my friends, I miss going out and just being by myself.</p>\n<p>I miss my room though, sleeping on my mums&#8217; couch isn&#8217;t ideal, but anything to protect my grandparents for a while.</p>\n<p>I miss the world.</p>\n<p>If only this virus would go to a galaxy far far away&#8230;</p>\n <p>I tried to be positive from the outset with the Covid-19 crisis. It soon became a shock how globally serious it was. On the whole, despite negative news, for me it has been positive. I have lived a little over a decade in Sydney having lived in Britain for some 25 years and I found isolation to be a period of consolidation.<br />\nIt was a task to be creative with isolation. You had to use your head with making do.</p>\n<p>I have discovered a liking for tapestry. It is very relaxing.<br />\nAt the moment, I wonder, probably as most do, how the future will be. For instance, how will cinemas be, and going to see shows?</p>\n<p>We will see too how cafes and restaurants will react. Will it be alternate seating, eg, as in America?<br />\nI think people used to be so keen to travel and now I wonder how enticing the travel bug will be?</p>\n <p>Sixty something female, happily married to the love of my life since 2007.</p>\n<p>So much to be thankful for in life.<br />\n6 great kids who are all independent.<br />\nA lovely home, no debt with wonderful neighbors.<br />\nRelatively good health if you don&#8217;t count sciatica, bad back &amp; dodgey knees.<br />\nThis time last year we were packing for an 8 week dream holiday to Europe, UK &amp; Singapore which was amazing.<br />\nI am working but hubby isn&#8217;t , for the first time in his life this week Centrelink will help him out.<br />\nAs we were both married before, we both planned on/need to work until pension age (67)</p>\n<p>Our plan at the end of this crisis is to travel more.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope this is all over as quickly as it arrived.</p>\n <p>Sitting on my lounge watching NBN news &#8211; nothing but Corona! Day in, day out..</p>\n<p>Each day I wake I silently thank ‘Whoever’ that I am well, purely for the fact that the thought of someone sticking a swab up my nose and at the back of my throat, makes me cringe! My kids are bored but I don’t worry: they are here and they are well. My husband is at work &#8211; so thankful for work!<br />\nDay in, day out..</p>\n<p>Only a few months ago I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my mum and dad from Perth, excited yet scared that they would catch Covid from the plane trip over, thankfully they didn’t but their trip was cut short because of border closures, so off they went back home after only a few days. In to self isolation for 14 days.</p>\n<p>Day in, day out..</p>\n<p>I’m thankful I can cook, I’m surrounded by family, I have a job, I can pay the bills without government assistance. I have time to look around me and appreciate what I have but most of all, day in and day out I’m alive.</p>\n <p>I am 21 years old. I am a preschool teacher and have Lost my job. I have been home for 10 weeks and counting.</p>\n<p>Isolating due to health issues. I have a compromised immune system.</p>\n <p>Financial markets meltdown<br />\nSocial dislocation<br />\nForced isolation<br />\nCountries in lock down<br />\nPlanes grounded<br />\nViral pandemic<br />\nGrips us all<br />\nSurvival of the fittest<br />\nHas never been<br />\nSo much at the fore</p>\n <p>We have been stuck at home for almost two months now. Spending this much time with my family is precious. </p>\n<p>We have been doing online schooling for over a month now and next week we will be going back to school for one day a week. Everyone is excited to see each other and be in routine.</p>\n<p>The virus came out of no where and Australia has coped very well with the never ending changes. Other countries haven’t been as lucky.</p>\n<p>I can’t wait until this is all over, and people can socialise and do day to day activities again.</p>\n<p>Currently, we cannot go out of the house unless we are going exercising, shopping, visiting relatives houses and, if needed, school and work.</p>\n<p>Supplies have started to come back into the shops at normal rates. We now have enough hand sanitiser, food and toilet paper available to everyone. Flu shots are running short as everyone wanted to get theirs before the flu season started.</p>\n<p>We are forever grateful for the endless work of the front line workers such as nurses, doctors, shop workers, nursing home and aged care workers and many more.</p>\n <p>Corona, making people be a loner. Which means being by them self while the toilet paper doesn’t last a shelf. </p>\n<p>Coronavirus is out of control while ruining peoples hopes and goals. Crushed dreams that make me want to scream while ruining my life because of COVID-19. The Government believe that we can’t leave but some people don’t care which is not fair. Quarantine is making people clean and out of thin air people are now dyeing their hair. Not seeing family and friends is annoying and makes it even more boring. While everyone is starting to crack and some people are just getting fat, chocolate and lollies are filling people trollies, we have not been through COVID-19. And this is how I feel, and it makes me want to squeal so thank you hope you enjoyed while our next-door neighbour is still making noise.</p>\n <p>May we never again<br />\ntake for granted:</p>\n<p>A crowded train<br />\nA waiting room<br />\nA long queue<br />\nOr even<br />\nA meeting<br />\nthat could have<br />\nbeen an email </p>\n<p>We once spent our days<br />\nwaiting for 5pm</p>\n<p>Now; trapped<br />\nat arms reach<br />\nwe long<br />\nfor connection<br />\nto those<br />\nwho feel<br />\nlike home. </p>\n <p>Whilst isolation has proven a challenge to the mind I&#8217;ve found epiphanies in the shadows of loneliness. I have discovered a useful manifesto for existence.<br />\nThat to live amongst nature, to find inspiration in art and music is really all one can wish for besides companionship to accompany it.</p>\n<p>Companionship need not come in the form of devotion from another, simply an unwavering love for others.</p>\n<p>A life cannot be lived in constant anticipation of fulfilment, one must take agency by the hands and guide it towards the world in which they want to live.</p>\n<p>These words have provided me with perspective in a time where their message seems so distant. </p>\n <p>I&#8217;ve decided that social isolation is just a fancy term for my normal life. It hasn&#8217;t been so very hard to adapt to the restrictions we have to live by now. Though I do miss buying fresh fruit from Wayne who has the kiosk on Market St. I miss going to club meetings for Birding NSW and just going a little further afield to go birdwatching; I miss the thought of being able to sit down for a bowl of laksa or catch up with a friend for lunch, where someone else had prepared it. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t miss crowds on the train coming into work &#8211; it&#8217;s rather special having an entire compartment for yourself. Yes, I still get to come in to the bookshop I&#8217;ve worked for for 20 years, though the hours have changed and we don&#8217;t allow customers in; the phone and web orders have kept a skeleton staff busy, even if quite a few calls have been about the slowness of delivery (poor Australia Post, guess that&#8217;s what happens when you gut the staff numbers and all of a sudden your delivery services are called upon again). </p>\n<p>I do wish the joggers would step aside on the paths which suddenly half the suburb have discovered. I&#8217;ve seen more dogs taking their owners for a walk (a vet friend tells me he is frantically busy &#8211; doggy injuries from too much walking! and gut-aches from too much food!) And the camellias are particularly magnificent this year, the views west from The Bridge are wonderfully clear, and the gloaming glow after Autumnal sunsets are especially beautiful. Sure, the world is beset with anxieties, overseas politicians play distraction games and The Second Wave will break when we least expect, but at the moment, it aint all bad.</p>\n <p>Like many other dogs, our dog loves isolation. More treats, more cuddles, more walks, lots of attention. We look into a forest of blue gums from our dining room and across a lawn from the living room so we don’t have the locked in feeling. Plenty of visits from birds who are appreciating the new freedoms.</p>\n<p>I am loving the Zoom experiences as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Always good to learn new skills.  Just can’t imagine what it would be like without the internet. Yesterday I was able to meet on line through the Department of Education’s platform with the Year 9 student I mentor who lives in a country town a long way from here. </p>\n<p>Recently I finished reading a book published in 2019 called “The Dreamers”  which was about a small town where a virus spread among college students. The effects were so similar to what we are currently experiencing that I wonder how the author Karen Thompson Walker feels knowing how close she has come to predicting the COVID19 pandemic.</p>\n <p>The biggest change to my life with Covid 19, has been the closing of swimming pools in the community. Swimming has been a huge part of my life for over 50 years and this virus had taken this from me. The longest absence from swimming, up until now, was child delivery, 6 weeks out of the water 4 times. It will be so amazing to have a real swim. I wish I lived near the ocean to be able to play in the water now beaches are open.</p>\n <p>&#8220;Old Mother Hubbard<br />\nWent to the cupboard,<br />\nTo give the poor dog a bone:<br />\nWhen she came there,<br />\nThe cupboard was bare,<br />\nAnd so the poor old dog had none.&#8221;<br />\nI feel like deja vu<br />\n&#8216;Cause it&#8217;s nothing really new<br />\nDifferent circumstances<br />\nSome happen chance<br />\nBut this time<br />\nGlobally, Governments are taking a different stance<br />\nIt&#8217;s a distressing sight<br />\nI must say &#8211; Ray<br />\nAnd I worry about our plight<br />\nIt&#8217;s a pathetic sight<br />\nAlright<br />\nA few items carefully stacked<br />\nAisles packed<br />\nShelves bare<br />\nFear has bred panic<br />\nThis has led to hoarding<br />\nBuyers don&#8217;t heed the Government&#8217;s warning<br />\nI fear for my sanity<br />\nThis morning I left<br />\nVanity<br />\nAt home<br />\n&#8216;Cause I joined the early birds<br />\nTo buy some essentials for home</p>\n <p>A whisper on the news of something happening in China, intrigued I started to check Twitter…Keeping me up at night, this became a nightly 2am check. Pictures of incomprehensible devastation created a thirst for more credible knowledge, more research and questioning of will it come here. The whispers slowly became louder. Hand sanitizer become scarce.  Surely not in Australia.  </p>\n<p>A story of someone held up for toilet paper in Singapore.  What? So a few extra items bought on way home each night.  A way of dealing with the internal panic of what might be coming.   Looking at people going about their shopping, oblivious to the incoming threat and wondering when will they realize things are about to change?  </p>\n<p>Then slowly a sense of calm came over me, but it seemed everyone else was now realizing the threat.  Fights in Australia over toilet paper.  I understood why.  Then haters against those panic buying. But didn’t they understand they are just scared?  I now had a motto “a little bit of control what you can control, a little bit of ‘what will be will be’, and just enjoy the gift of each day.  </p>\n<p>Be kind, compassionate and support those more vulnerable. Share your toilet paper and sanitizer with your elderly neighbor. Take the chance to #bebetter”.  Sadness that our elderly are vulnerable but deep gratitude of how lucky we are to be in Australia, to have the support we have and this rare opportunity to take time to pause and reflect on how we might be better when this all over.  </p>\n<p>Disruption creates opportunity &#8211; what opportunity will come from this?  Perhaps just as we have listened to the scientists to keep us safe during this pandemic, we can listen to their expertise for climate change…and we change our behaviors and #becomebetter</p>\n <p>I have only just started to get used to this new but bizarre life that has not only affected me, but millions of people around the world.</p>\n<p>I never would have imagined spending year 11 mostly online, stuck at home. whilst I don&#8217;t have it bad, it still seems so surreal. </p>\n<p>I would have dreamed of staying home allllll day last year and the years before, but at this present stage, I can not think of anything worse.</p>\n<p>But there are some positives, I&#8217;m going out for walks more, doing more home exercises and even learning new languages. </p>\n<p>Life is strange, but I know it won&#8217;t last forever. I just hope we can all learn from this and make sure this never happens again. Because, after this pandemic, the world will never be the same.</p>\n<p>I just can not wait until this is over, because I know I will make sure to be grateful for every moment I have!</p>\n <p>Isolation has become my friend.</p>\n<p>Isolation and I are on good terms at the moment. He lets me read and write, (with little complaining) though I have to give him some attention during the day, otherwise he groans and moans about the place. </p>\n<p>“I know,” I say. “I see you, and you matter. Don’t be silly.”</p>\n<p>Of course, I’m talking to my front door. Locked and keeping shut.<br />\nI don’t think it’s been opened in weeks. I’ve lost track of the days, it says it’s 2020, yet I have my doubts.<br />\nDoubts have riddled my aching mind for the nights kept awake.<br />\nHowever, larger things are at stake. </p>\n<p>Update:<br />\nToday, I opened the front door named Isolation, felt the cool breeze waft over as if in a greeting. </p>\n<p>Then I sneezed and coughed at the same time.<br />\nI’m back inside, until further notice. </p>\n<p>&#8211; J.W </p>\n <p>Talk begins and ends with COVID<br />\nthoughts contend with growing numbers<br />\nthose infected, rates of dying<br />\nwill it take a global virus<br />\nto recalibrate the world with kindness?</p>\n<p>Sunday: what’s left</p>\n<p>furniture with legs going nowhere<br />\ntempting to add two more to theirs<br />\nstretch out and let Corona run unstoppable</p>\n<p>a morning walk with unexpected pleasure,<br />\nneighbours never met<br />\nrising up from sofa beds and desks</p>\n<p>to cycle jog stroll and step<br />\nphysically distant<br />\non this new-found common ground</p>\n<p>profound as the friend<br />\nwho calls it resurrection</p>\n<p>I’m keeping busy<br />\nindoors while my resident spider<br />\ncontinues her outside task<br />\nof spinning a curtain across my kitchen window<br />\nintricate pattern wispy thin<br />\ncatching glints of autumn sun<br />\nit’s my lunchtime but<br />\nas yet she has none</p>\n<p>waking now to silence<br />\neven the currawong<br />\nwhose droppings adorn my courtyard paving<br />\nhas forgotten her song</p>\n<p>hearing the earth murmur<br />\nit’s the depth of wordless keening<br />\ncreatures grieving our self-inflicted blindness<br />\nour planet lamenting</p>\n<p>safe to touch to kiss and hug<br />\nto commute with strangers on a train<br />\nand not be bothered by a shoulder brush?</p>\n<p>safe to shop to meet for lunch<br />\nto shake another person’s hand<br />\nno longer anxious over human touch?</p>\n<p>an answer comes<br />\nthis too will end<br />\nbut when has it ever been completely safe</p>\n<p>to kiss to hug and trust another with our scars<br />\nto shed our masks<br />\nand bare our pummeled hearts?</p>\n<p>becalmed but not calm<br />\nunsure of ever reaching my shore<br />\nfearful of a sudden wind<br />\ntipping me into chaos<br />\nanxious of becoming less not more</p>\n<p>from somewhere near my centre<br />\ncomes a prompt about control<br />\nchoose what brings renewal<br />\njettison what is dead<br />\nlet go of yesterday<br />\nit’s time to trim the sail</p>\n <p>We can&#8217;t go back, can we? </p>\n<p>I was running around from errand to errand before this. From event to event. From work to play. From the gym to the pub. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t miss much of it at all. All the FOMO is gone. I&#8217;m realising that what matters I already have. I can drink my cup of coffee, in my favourite ceramic mug, on the balcony and watch the sun come up. The morning air is cold now, my coffee mug warms my hands and the heat seeps into me. </p>\n<p>I listen to music in my bedroom and dance around. Flailing, jumping, skipping, shaking. I feel like the performative element of our lives has been taken away, and when it&#8217;s all stripped back, we&#8217;ve only got ourselves to be with. It&#8217;s just me in my undies dancing in my room, and honestly it feels so joyful. </p>\n<p>Simple uncomplicated joy. </p>\n <p>I am 72, female and live with my husband in Salamander Bay. We have been self isolating for 6 weeks and I have found a  new sense of calm. Instead of having busy mornings rushing off to the gym 5 days a week I now go for a walk before doing an online class with our generous gym instructors who are keeping us oldies fit by doing classes on Zoom. Easy! We can all have a chat after which keeps us connected and we are very grateful for this.</p>\n<p>My daughter had forbidden me to go out to shop and said she would do it for me while working from home, keeping her household running and home schooling 3 children AND driving the 30 minutes to deliver my shopping. I declined her offer and said I would do home delivery, but I never did! </p>\n<p>The only other times we leave the house is to walk twice daily and shop for groceries. We have discovered so many beautiful walks in our area that we would otherwise not have found. Medical appointments have been by phone.<br />\nAfter leading very busy lives socialising, attending the gym (me) and playing golf (my husband) I have been surprised how accepting I have been at staying home and actually enjoying my time. I am reading, doing craft projects, tackling jigsaws and my house and garden are now clean and organised.</p>\n<p>Having 6 grandchildren who live fairly close I have missed seeing them on a regular basis but thanks to facetime and phones we have been able to keep up to date with how they are coping. In April/May we have 5 birthdays and thanks to modern technology we have been able to celebrate via Zoom, such fun! It is all good!</p>\n <p>LIFE IN THE PANDEMIC</p>\n<p>My initial experience of life in the pandemic was to spend two weeks in social isolation as I had been a Close Contact with a Confirmed Case. This was in early March and whilst initially confronting was a nice chance to spend time working from home.</p>\n<p>The third and fourth week of March saw the rapid rise in cases across Australia and the imposition of restrictions on movement. Whilst still only weeks ago they were challenging times. Initially they were &#8216;unprecedented&#8217; but of course they have happened in historical times. Then the times felt &#8216;surreal&#8217; and like something that was happening in an abstract sense. And now only eight weeks ago the times have settled into a sense of being the &#8216;new normal&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I enjoy history and what has struck me the most during this time is that we are actively living history in the present. This will be a time that society reflects upon into the future and it is a time that we have been actively experiencing.</p>\n<p>After a sustained focus on public health, flattening of curves, hand washing and social distancing, I find increasingly that I am thinking about economic health and the human and social impact of job losses. I remember the 1991 recession and the 2008 global financial crisis. And what I most remember is the people who lost jobs and the families that experienced ongoing years of hardship.</p>\n<p>Whilst I have begun to feel optimistic about the public health of the nation, at this time I remain pessimistic about the economic health of the nation. At the start of the pandemic I was comforted with the Persian adage &#8216;this too shall pass&#8217; and I hope that this remains true for health, economic and social impact.</p>\n <p>Completing my final year of schooling, my HSC year, during this unprecedented time has been a true test of my ability to stay on task and persevere. With online learning meaning face-to-face conversations with teachers and peers is impossible, and all class times being spent on video or audio calls to discuss content, it has been difficult staying on track and engaged with every subject.</p>\n<p>Not being able to go out of the house and catchup with friends is really upsetting and Ive noticed how being cooped up in the house for four+ weeks straight has affected my mental health. There are only so many times you can take the dog for a walk every day.</p>\n <p>Life, meaning, and the universe.</p>\n<p>Staying home looked like a fantastic opportunity &#8211; but for what? Deeper questions aren&#8217;t on people&#8217;s minds. We just concentrate on managing &#8211; and surviving. I said that I would write &#8211; but this is the first piece &#8211; after 7 weeks!</p>\n<p>So far our experience at home has been great- but where has the time gone?<br />\nHealthy boomers with a partner- we are blessed.<br />\nReading, chatting, decluttering, developing technology skills&#8230;..<br />\nOne of us was trained in infectious disease nursing at Prince Henry Hospital. It certainly helped us draw the line at a point where most of the community could see no danger.<br />\nRetired ad living a suburban block with long term neighbors,<br />\nwith our cruising days behind us, it is almost too good to believe.<br />\nBut &#8211; this is only the beginning.<br />\nOur plan?<br />\nRead a Psalm and carry on.</p>\n <p>I&#8217;m not going to lie. I&#8217;ve broken some of the social isolation/distancing regulations that the state has implemented. I&#8217;ve had a few friends over a couple of times recently. The rest of the time though I&#8217;ve observed social distancing regulations. I wound up basically refurnishing my apartment in social isolation. I&#8217;d needed to do this anyway but the lockdown sped up the process. I also bought a few appliances I hadn&#8217;t planned to such as a breadmaker, a sandwich maker and a coffee machine. </p>\n<p>My home now resembles a gym with a couple of pieces of home fitness equipment. I had to adapt after gyms were closed. Before lockdown I&#8217;d bought a kitten and got her about six weeks before lockdown begun. Since lockdown started I&#8217;ve been working from home. There are some things I&#8217;m looking forward to when lockdown ends. I&#8217;m looking forward to going to bars with friends again and I&#8217;m looking forward to concerts. I&#8217;m also looking forward to overseas travel again. I want to keep working from home though.</p>\n <p>My name is Linda Pauline Heenan (nee Hammond). I was born in Akaroa, New Zealand, and moved to Australia in about 1979. I joined the Christian Outreach Centre Youth Country Evangelism Team and met my future husband, John Francis Heenan. At the point of beginning this journal, we have been married about 36 years and have two adult children &#8211; Shaun Michael Heenan, who still lives with us, and Kaitlyn Rose Barnes, who lives just round the corner with her husband, William. They produced a beautiful baby girl named Eleanor Rose, 8 months ago. She joins two half siblings from Kaitlyn&#8217;s first marriage &#8211; Byron Heenan Lewis, aged 14, and Ariya Kaylee Lewis, aged 5. This information is for future relatives who may wish to research their ancestry.</p>\n<p>Two days ago, the children and grandchildren visited for the first time in about two months. We have been under covid-19 lockdown, along with the rest of Australia and much of the world. I went into isolation several weeks earlier than most because I am in such a high risk category. For the last four years, I&#8217;ve been on chemo to defeat metasticised breast cancer. It has damaged my bones severely. I&#8217;ve been in partial remission for a couple of years but the chemo weakens my immune system, making me one of those most likely to die from the coronavirus. </p>\n<p>It was wonderful to see my family again and to hug my grandchildren. They have been safely isolated and home schooling, so it was safe to hug. Byron is now taller than me. Ariya has learnt to read from the work her school has been sending and the system I bought for her. Ellie can stand up by herself while saying &#8220;Up!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I will continue this story in short excerpts over time.</p>\n <p>Although self isolation restrictions are being rescinded (slowly) I still don&#8217;t want to leave home.  I&#8217;ve been incredibly lucky to have kept my job during this time, but I&#8217;m still scared to go places. Obviously I am kinda going crazy not going places, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t know there isn&#8217;t really a but to add in there. I finished all my assignments for my degree, so there isn&#8217;t really anything for me to do. Although I have become obsessed with my spotify account making, sure my playlists are up to date. I will say having nothing to do is making me find things to do, like Chloe Ting workouts, cleaning the house, actually taking time to look after myself and helping my family, its been nice.</p>\n<p>My Sister is a graduate nurse and has been flat out during this pandemic, its incredible the amount of people she has helped in the few months since she began her job. While my sister has been off helping save lives my Mum has stepped up to teach the students in her school continue learning. While teachers are not allowed into classrooms the teacher aides have taken on the role of guiding the learning of their students, she is stressed, but the kids she works with absolutely love her. </p>\n<p>Its weird to know I&#8217;ve been living through a major part of modern history, and I&#8217;ve been coping through memes and tiktok videos. I wonder how this will change how we interact with each other, I love the no touching thing (especially working with kids). But I would like a steady toilet paper supply back. Like in a few years I could be teaching students about this pandemic, and tell the kids about my own experiences and the experiences of those around me.</p>\n <p>Monday, Pandemic Week 8.<br />\nFrom my house I have observed the following every weekend since the pandemic was declared:<br />\n Pub car park &#8211; Abandoned<br />\n Bottleshop drive through &#8211; Full<br />\n RSL car park &#8211; Abandoned<br />\n Cinema car park &#8211; Sporadic skateboarders<br />\n Bunnings car park &#8211; Full<br />\n Aldi car park &#8211; Full<br />\n OfficeWorks car park &#8211; Full<br />\n Maccas in-store &#8211; Empty<br />\n Maccas drive-through &#8211; Around the block<br />\n Centrelink line &#8211; Around the block<br />\n Anaconda car park &#8211; &#8230;Full  !?<br />\n Playgrounds &#8211; Surrounded by police tape</p>\n<p>So, if you want to buy anything, fix anything, eat anything, exercise or plan a camping trip you&#8217;re fine. Just don&#8217;t be old, alone, young, or low income&#8230; oh, and don&#8217;t plan to use the internet for anything outside of work. </p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s average NBN speed 38.44 Mbps Down, 6.22up (normally 101.4, 22.8).</p>\n<p>Average air pollution is the lowest I&#8217;ve seen it in thirty years though.<br />\n:) </p>\n <p>Have just heard about this site on the ABC news.  As  74 and 75 year old retirees we are enjoying isolation!  It is so nice not to have a calendar full of appointments and places to be by set times. We may be alone, but are far from lonely!  We have a nice daily routine, and I don&#8217;t know where the day disappears to.  I am doing more cooking, we are eating well, Woolworths and the Chemist deliver to us &#8211; we have plenty of food and toilet paper 😀  We are eating vegetables from our long established vegetable garden every night for tea. </p>\n<p>We stay in touch with our son in Sydney by text, email and phone, and enjoy Whatsapp texts, photos and videos from our son and our grandchildren, who are isolating in Germany with Daughter-in-law&#8217;s parents.  They are unsure when they can return home to Glasgow.  I watch our weekly church service on line, and I email friends, or phone them, catching up with at least one person every day.  As long as the governments are working together to control the spread, and keep every one safe we are happy.  </p>\n<p>I do feel for those poor people in the nursing homes &#8211; there was obviously a monumental stuff-up there.   They should have been checking and testing all who entered long before this.  Our local nursing home instituted these protocols even before the governments rulings &#8211; no Covid19 cases there &#8211; well done!</p>\n <p>I started writing Log Notes in the form of a Star Trek Ships Captain for the amusement of friends and to pass the time in isolation &#8211; here a some samplers.</p>\n<p>Captain&#8217;s Log<br />\nIn my Isolated Pod detached from the main ship, the NCSS Pyrmont, out in the dark black hole which has become known as the Corona Constellation. I and my colleagues have been busy trying to avoid Space Cabin Fever and the COVID virus. My approach has been to keep busy with domestic duties like re-tiling the space bathroom and modernizing the galley bench tops. Lucky for us the Klingon&#8217;s have been observing the Federation&#8217;s Isolation directives which has given us the time to indulge our diversions.  Life has become very repetitive and each day is starting to melt into the previous. </p>\n<p>Out here in the Isolation Pods life is going on, and on and on. The days like gum on the bottom of your shoe are stretching from one step to the next. Food wise I have become so lazy that I can no longer be bothered pushing the button on the replicator and I feel like I am living on almonds and cashews. The cashews would be nice if I had some stir fried beef to go with them as well as some fried rice. This morning the Editorial Squadron now all in isolation from the mother ship still docked in stasis in the middle of the COVID black hole in Pyrmont, had a SLACK meeting [not a slack meeting but a meeting via the Slack App &#8211; who names these thing?]. The meeting was cheerful and it was nice to hear the voices of colleagues even if they were just icons on a phone screen bobbing in and out as the NBN failed the unfailed.</p>\n <p>Starting week 7 of working from home, I am thankful that I am in an industry that can easily accommodate such working conditions.</p>\n<p>I do miss the interaction of my work mates and even travelling on public transport to and from work.<br />\nAs for family, we were fortunate last weekend to see our 91 year old mother, who is going extremely well considering the current conditions.</p>\n<p>Isolation (or social distancing) is difficult, but I believe it&#8217;s the only way to get on top of this virus.</p>\n<p>Be safe everyone.</p>\n <p>This is the beginning of the 8th week of quarantine&#8230;<br />\nI&#8217;m working from home (from all of my three different jobs), and try to leave the house every day, but sometimes, I&#8217;ll admit that I forget!<br />\nI&#8217;m not quite sure why everyone is talking about the extra time that they have available by being in isolation &#8211; I&#8217;m as busy as ever! But I am cooking more, and more interesting things too&#8230;</p>\n <p>I have a secure job, but my vocation &#8211; the thing that gets me fired up each week &#8211; is acting and the theatre. Through several difficult years it, and my theatre family, have kept me sane and balanced. Now it&#8217;s completely unavailable in its usual form and I&#8217;ve been feeling the loss keenly. </p>\n<p>But the truly wonderful things about Creatives is that they have to keep creating, no matter what. So we&#8217;ve moved all our activities online. I&#8217;m a member of a Facebook group of actors, musicians, writers, artists&#8230;.every week we set a new challenge to keep us engaged and active. We&#8217;ve written and filmed monologues and short plays (filmed in isolation). We&#8217;ve recorded radio plays. We&#8217;re working on a podcast series&#8230;.I recently joined &#8220;Streamed Shakespeare&#8221; and am excited to be preparing some audition recordings. Every week, prestigious theatre companies and artists make recordings of live performances available for free to entertain us in our isolation and raise awareness of the valuable contribution the arts make to our lives.</p>\n<p>It saddens me that the Arts &#8211; an industry that contributes $111 billion to the Australian economy each year, and which is now keeping so many of us sane through the streaming contributions we&#8217;re consuming like crazy &#8211; has been largely forgotten in terms of support.</p>\n <p>As an active and healthy retiree, the Covid 19 Pandemic has not had any negative effects on me personally. While I feel strongly for those many Australians who have lost their jobs, struggling to feed their families and pay rent or mortgages, I so very fortunately don’t have financial problems.</p>\n<p>Prior to these social isolation days, my weeks were very busy Like many retired Australians I am involved in voluntary work.</p>\n<p>I also play ukulele with a group of other musicians, attend Church services and a Bible Study group, exercise with yoga, Tai Chi, and tennis. I swim every morning, read avidly, and enjoy various crafts.</p>\n<p>Although I miss socialising during these activities, I can amuse myself quite well at home while social isolating.<br />\nThis pandemic has given me extra time that I wouldn’t normally have to engage in projects I have had on hold for so long. I have completed my Family History, written it into a readable form and distributed it to family members.</p>\n<p>I have cooked and shared the results with neighbours. I have lists of people from my various groups that I phone or email regularly. I have been in contact with long lost friends and those I haven’t seen for a while. I now have my garden looking very spruce, and due to my wonderful local public library delivering books to my home, I have been able to continue reading.</p>\n<p>Most of my peers I am in contact with feel much the same as me. One friend commented that she will be too busy to start socialising again when the pandemic is over.</p>\n<p>We baby boomer generation recognise how fortunate we have been through life, and even now don’t consider ourselves in the over 70s group vulnerable to this coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Sandra Wingrave<br />\nCentral Coast, NSW</p>\n <p>I am stuck at home amidst this corona pandemic, it was my 17th birthday 2 days ago and it wasn&#8217;t the same, lockdown is taking it&#8217;s toll on humanity and people are slowly spiralling into insanity, however a lot of very cool hairstyles and colours have come out of this.</p>\n <p>ICU. [pt. 3]</p>\n<p>At the end of our interview, I asked Katherine how she felt when she saw those now seminal images of speedo and bikini clad bodies stretched across the sands of iconic Bondi Beach…</p>\n<p>‘It’s heartbreaking. Seeing those images was really heartbreaking. Seeing those people not really making that community effort”</p>\n<p>Brazen with dedication, doctors like Katherine and Rita are some of the lower paid in our medical system yet they’re showing up day in, day out, putting their lives on the line for us.</p>\n<p>How could those outliers on Bondi beach lack that intensive care for the people we need most right now?</p>\n<p>How could they completely disregard social distancing measures that would help flatten the curve?</p>\n<p>How could they do this knowing they’re disrespecting these brave soldiers, in public hospitals, at medical centres, on our frontlines, fighting this battle so selflessly. Knowing that staying home, will actually help save these hero medics lives, so they can continue working to save ours.</p>\n<p>Reading over my notes tonight, watching these raw interviews back, I just can’t help but wonder how Rita, Katherine and all of the others on the frontline I had the privilege of meeting, get to sleep at night.</p>\n<p>As I lay my body to rest, the tears release from my heart, the trenches in my mind still emblazoned with images of what this new world could look like if we don’t ALL do every single bit we can, to protect those at greatest risk.</p>\n<p>To protect our most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>To protect one another.</p>\n<p>And I just hope that those deniers who do more damage to Rita than they know, those outliers that continue to break Katherines heart, will think about that, the next time they decide to go out unnecessarily…</p>\n<p>ICU.</p>\n<p>They see you.</p>\n<p>We all see you.</p>\n <p>I had a spontaneous cry this morning. </p>\n<p>Sitting at my kitchen table come home office I overheard a snippet on the morning news about bodies being stacked up outside a funeral home in the US. COVID has caused so many deaths in such a short time they have been overwhelmed. I just lost it. Tears poured down my face for a few minutes, and then as quickly as it started it stopped. I wiped a few stray drops off my laptop and got back to work. </p>\n<p>Because what else can I do?</p>\n<p>I wonder if this has happened to anyone else.  </p>\n <p>Last month ended differently to what I thought it would.  It started with a short break with a friend in the middle of nowhere.  Instead of being the breather we both needed, we spent the time worrying about what was going on in the world.  We both got home to the news that yes we are working from home for the forseeable future. </p>\n<p>A few days later the news that a relative was not mentally coping, hadn&#8217;t for a while and had checked themselves into a mental health facility.  I was asked to visit them.  Take them outside and get some fresh air.  And shock horror, hug them.  That hug was by then illegal, and so badly needed by both of us.</p>\n<p>Those 2 weeks were hard.  They had to do the hard work of getting better, and will be ongoing.  Watching someone you love more than your own life in such pain and being unable to do anything but hold each others sanitised hands.</p>\n<p>I want this to be over soon, I need another hug.  And for them to reach their 18th birthday.</p>\n <p>I love free stuff.  Earlier this week I drove past a drive-through testing clinic.  I have had a slightly sore chest and occasional cough so did my civic duty. I contacted the COVID-19 helpline for a symptom check, which led to contacting my GP which led to getting me tested&#8230;  for FREE! Winning!  </p>\n<p>That was Wednesday morning, it&#8217;s now Friday morning and I still don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m not worried I might have it, even with my penchant for hypochondria, I know the risk is extremely low. Now I&#8217;m fully isolated at home until I get the result.  I had been spending my days working and co-parenting my 6 year old daughter at the apartment where she lives with her Mum.  </p>\n<p>I am very privileged. I have a job, a good one. I can work remotely. I can video call friends, family and colleagues. I have food and wine. I can listen to records while I work and drink coffee at my desk. There&#8217;s a lot about this I could happily get used to but after just two days, I dearly miss being face to face with my daughter and I&#8217;m reminded that just below the surface there is a great anxiety and sadness for this pandemic.</p>\n<p>This must be a living hell for so many people with so much more to worry about.</p>\n <p>Sleep is no longer a friend.</p>\n<p>I have always been blessed with the ability to sleep. Waking in the night used to be for me a vaguely pleasant moment.  I would realise I was awake and think that this was just a reminder that I was free to go back to sleep again, and so enjoy the feeling of drifting off again.</p>\n<p>But in this world gone awry, waking in the night is a time to be reminded that my family&#8217;s safety is no longer in my control. Worrying about your children&#8217;s safety and happiness comes with the umbilical cord and can never be severed. It&#8217;s just part of the package of parenting.</p>\n<p>I lie in the blackness and worry about my girls; The one who has worked with all her heart and soul to build a business and follow her dream, only to have it smashed by events out of her control just as it was beginning to get solid; The one  who is looking after pangolins and other assorted wild creatures in Malawi – who even knew what they were before they were being blamed for this plague &#8211; my comments to her about my being ok with her living in third world countries as long as she has first world medical care is haunting me; The one who is working in a NICU in Galway University Hospital, close to the front line in this dreadful battle – and for the first time in their lives I am helpless to keep them safe</p>\n<p>And so I lie awake and struggle to breathe and wait for dawn when the crazy world of working from home provides a few moments of distraction</p>\n <p>ICU. [pt.2]</p>\n<p>Doctors like Dr Rita Almohty, who I’d met a week earlier at her medical centre, where one of the early positive diagnoses was made. I’d seen articles quoting healthcare workers speaking out anonymously, but Rita bravely took the leap and sat down to share the grim reality of her working life… </p>\n<p>‘Every day is a battle, it’s a challenge, every day I actually think, I don’t want to die.’ She opens up about how she feels for those doctors in Italy. How like them she just wants to help people, so I ask…</p>\n<p>‘Do you feel you&#8217;re putting your life at risk by going to work every day?’ Her response blows up my ability to hold back emotion. </p>\n<p>’Yeah, I do, she says. I&#8217;ve got a two-and a half year old. I&#8217;m a single mum and I&#8217;m also six months pregnant, so I&#8217;ve got to worry about the unborn baby as well.’ </p>\n<p>I didn’t expect that. Sadness starts to seep through.</p>\n<p>Imagine having to make that decision every day… ‘do I put my family at risk and my unborn child or do I go to work and try to save lives?’  </p>\n<p>The conflict between my head and my heart fighting to comprehend the scale of that wave the doctors in ICU fear will hit.</p>\n<p>I’m defeated, tears exploding inside, still trying to shield Dr Almohty from dealing with my grief.</p>\n<p>Instead, siphoning that emotion into words for my story that start scribing themselves under my skin. </p>\n<p>Dr Almohty’s descriptors paint the same solemn images I pictured on the walls in the ICU corridors while speaking with Doctor Katherine Pearce. We stood 1.5metres apart. The distance between us, a protection, not only against the spread of the virus, but the emotion I can see she too is holding back.</p>\n<p>More tomorrow&#8230;</p>\n <p>It&#8217;s my grandmother I worry about most during this situation. </p>\n<p>My grandfather passed six months ago, not long before this all began to unravel. Seventy years of marriage and living in the same house in Fairfield, watching acres of fields transform into acres of housing development. </p>\n<p>In a wheelchair, unable to fully care for herself, and still mourning the loss of her husband, she isolated at home for two weeks knowing it could be the last time she&#8217;s in that house. Her body may be failing her, but her mind is still sharp. Linda, Nan to me, and Nan Nan to my kids, is a resilient woman, always has been.</p>\n<p>Newmarch House Nursing Home had a great reputation and the family was thrilled she had been accepted into a place that would bring her closer to the rest of her family and provide great care. We moved her into the facility where she was to isolate in her new room for a further two weeks. </p>\n<p>On just her second day allowed to meet the other residents and participate in the daily activities, the COVID 19 outbreak within the facility began. </p>\n<p>Back to isolation. For the foreseeable future. </p>\n<p>Her daily interactions as positive notices surround her, as does the death toll, include meals being placed on a table by staff in full protective gear, and having her temperature and vitals observed four times daily. Still ok, still negative, its a daily anxiety-filled sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>The family talks to her daily. But it must be lonely. And foreign-feeling. </p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t stand looking at social media any more and its sudden plethora of keyboard pandemic experts every time there&#8217;s a new story on Newmarch House. It&#8217;s that or people complaining of boredom. Bullshit. You have no idea.</p>\n<p>But she&#8217;s a resilient woman.</p>\n <p>It started raining today.</p>\n<p>I’ve been hoping for rain, for hours of solid downpour, for weeks. To break the monotony mostly. To prove that this day really is different from yesterday, from six weeks ago. </p>\n<p>The rain has been heavy enough to irritate the birds and noisy enough to cover the fact that the city is so quiet. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, the rain was an excuse to stay inside. I could avoid essential errands and essential exercise; I could avoid all the joggers and the runners and the idlers who don’t think that social distancing is important. </p>\n<p>So, I stayed home. I had breakfast. I read the newspapers. I interacted with people on social media. I responded to some emails. I worked. I drank too much coffee. I checked social media again. I had lunch. I thought about looking at data visualisations of COVID-19 – red plumes on a map indicating concentrations of coronavirus nestled alongside a list estimating the number of deaths – and decided not to. I kept working. I drank more coffee. I looked at social media one more time. </p>\n<p>I tried not to be jealous of all the people with cats. Small, furry alarm clocks insisting on being fed and petted and then fed again (because, well, that first feeding didn’t really count). A purring cat is the most delightful thing. Especially when the world is upside down.</p>\n<p>I had dinner.</p>\n<p>I sat and listened to the rain. </p>\n <p>ICU. [pt.1]</p>\n<p>Today, I spent the morning in ICU.</p>\n<p>Intensive. Care. Unit.</p>\n<p>I’m not sick, but rather sick of the deniers, ignoring the reality of this new world that we all find ourselves in. Let me share with you why.</p>\n<p>It’s the first-time doctors are allowing cameras inside an ICU in Australia as they prepare for what they’re calling the COVID-19 peak. 3 hours into our shoot, in a single moment, the reality of how coronavirus has changed our lives forever hits me like a tsunami.</p>\n<p>In my mind, I find myself drowning in the waves of worst-case scenarios the doctors, nurses and support staff so vividly describe.</p>\n<p>Doctors like Katherine, a trainee GP I’m stealing time with. She never planned in her residency she’d be working in a pandemic. Telling me she’s already been in ICU for 10 weeks with no end in sight, I can see she’s somewhat anxious so I ask…</p>\n<p>‘Do you feel like you have to put on a brave face?’</p>\n<p>She explains that many critically ill coronavirus patients won’t be allowed visitors. Describing what sounds like a very lonely death, her fears start to ricochet off the sterile corridors we’re standing in. She spit fires descriptions of what the virus can do, the nightmare unfolding in Spain and Italy. In my mind, a series of numbers go off like cannons. 20,000 coronavirus patients now dead in Italy, 100 of those doctors. 15,000 Spanish medical workers now sick. And many of them have described the battle against this disease as war.</p>\n<p>In my heart, I feel for Katherine and the rising number of her fellow medics here in Australia now self-isolating with symptoms many testing positive.</p>\n<p>I can’t help but worry for these brave soldiers on our frontlines.</p>\n<p>More tomorrow….</p>\n <p>5 April </p>\n<p>A fortnight after shutdown, on the first night after daylight savings, the household is on video calls. Kiddo is hand-standing with his trapeze troupe. Partner is meeting the new golden retriever puppy of a friend. I wander between the two. They are here but not hearing. It’s the absent presence we now live. </p>\n<p>By 5.40 the sun is glowing apricot between the box trees at the end of the lane. It feels right that we should now be eased into an earlier darkness each day. As if winter is collapsing us more and more into this grand internal life. </p>\n<p>10 April </p>\n<p>Out walking, my lines of sight have become telescopic. I notice things in ones. The tiny gumleaf embossed in what was once drying concrete. A flower defying two adjacent fence palings. A sentinel cat on a low brick wall. How quickly the mind obeys the isolation order. </p>\n<p>23 April </p>\n<p>Adaptation has made unfathomable things regular now. Our bodies align automatically on footpaths, in aisles and doorways. We shift single file, wait and pass, reluctant to co-exist within the distance of breath. We look for each other in windows decked with teddy bears, in front rooms that have become offices, in dining rooms that are gyms, through open doors that provide signs of life. </p>\n<p>A woman sits on a household wall talking to friends through their living room window. The graffiti below her reads ‘Revolution is a Process’. </p>\n<p>30 April </p>\n<p>Just after breakfast as I head to my home desk, I hear a guy in the lane call out: ‘Thank you, stay safe.’ I hear it and read it often now – ‘Stay safe!’ Safety is now the imperative of choice. And staying. It’s another phrase for our new vocabulary. Isolation, social distance, quarantine, confinement, stay safe, zoom.</p>\n <p>SHUT DOWN WEEK FIVE:</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t actually believe how fast the time&#8217;s going. Working or studying full-time for over 50 years now, this extended time at home has been a first in my adult life, and I’m taking it as a rare gift. </p>\n<p>But I know I’m very fortunate. The world is anxious. Many have lost their lives or are doing it really tough while I have a secure salary, no debt, a long-term partner &amp;; a nice place to live. In fact, we’d just de-cluttered the house &amp; garden for a big party we’d planned before social gathering restrictions took effect so we don’t even have household chores to do unless we want to. As I type, the rain is falling, giving the garden a good soak for us.</p>\n<p>I’m lucky to be able to work at home, enjoying the quiet with time spare to explore the world of online learning. Social isolation has encouraged our technology-averse tribe to engage in Facetime. We&#8217;ve set up online chats &amp;; dinner parties with friends &amp;; family &#8211; what joy it’s been for my 90-year-old Mother to see her Perth-based grand-daughter after 5 years and keep in visual communication with my disabled sister. Libby is hearing-impaired &amp;; autistic, living in a care home in the community but unable to make a home visit since the shutdown. </p>\n<p>Other experiences are not so uplifting – I’ll never forget the intense fear I felt when a dry cough and 38+° temp led to a CV-19 test in Week Three, nor the stressful 24 hrs that followed, waiting for the delivery of my &#8216;negative&#8217; result. I can&#8217;t describe the sense of relief when I realised how close I’d come to this truly terrifying infection.</p>\n<p>These are the worst of times and the most extraordinary of times…</p>\n <p>Since early March I’ve been working from home. With most of my family self – isolating down the South Coast that has meant time alone in an apartment in inner-west Sydney. There have been the usual nbn teething problems, scandi noir binge watching and daily walks but no change to work! Still just as busy with the complexity of online meetings and moving deadlines.</p>\n<p>What’s missing – laughter! Last Friday night I had a virtual drink with a group of my oldest friends – seriously – I have known two since I was four years old. The drinks were supposed to be with the girls, but the husbands started appearing in the background, refreshing drinks or just butting in with comments. There we were online exchanging witty one-liners, sharing absurd memories from almost fifty years of friendship. One of them has bought a gin still and has been testing the latest batch with his family to mixed reviews. Another was trying to find the planets that were supposed to be appearing in the night sky. Laughed ‘til I cried – that’s what I needed. </p>\n<p>It’s the incidental conversations with family that you miss – the arguments about what you will watch together, the inability to agree on take away, the exclamations about another trip needed to the recycle bin!   </p>\n<p>It’s the incidental conversations at work that you miss – the shared laughs and gossip, the outrage at the latest misstep from a colleague, the complaints about the coffee, the illicit eating of chocolate at your desk. </p>\n<p>It’s the incidental conversations with friends that you miss – when they are leaving for their next overseas trip (groan), what’s on sale at Aldi this week and what was the book we were reading for Book club – I’ve forgotten!</p>\n <p>A man, who was a boy when I last spoke to him, just slid into my DMs. I have a feeling the isolation is making him nostalgic. I started to think about the road not taken. A life not led. Perhaps it&#8217;s the benefit of time or knowing the world as it is now. I felt&#8230; relief. Twenty-year-old me may not have felt this way at the time but here&#8217;s to near misses, and being grateful for the person you did end-up with during a pandemic.  </p>\n <p>We’re just finishing Week Four of ‘lockdown’. It’s a blue sky day here in Sydney- unusually warm for Autumn. The sapphire harbour is devoid of cruise and cargo ships, airplanes have been replaced with Rainbow Lorikeets, the normally chock-a-block road to the harbour bridge is lightly freckled with vehicles. It reminds me of the Sydney I grew up in. It was a simpler, slower time where kids ‘swam’ under garden sprinklers.</p>\n<p>Some say that ‘we’re all in this together’ but depending on your support and finances some are more ‘in this’ than others. Many of us have lost our jobs. Yet life goes on. My elderly mother broke her hip, my daughter had a Zoom birthday, my son’s far away. A friend of mine is constantly checking her temperature because she says ‘I have the worst combination of vulnerabilities- menopause and hypochondria.’</p>\n<p>Despite our differences we’ve also shared a lot in lockdown- in particular the tides of emotion. At first, we were almost festive, like the entire nation was heading off on a camping holiday. But then very quickly anxiety grew. With the barrage of change and uncertainty people stopped acknowledging each other in the street- as though a shared smile could spread the virus.</p>\n<p>Today we’re smiling again as there’s talk of easing restrictions. But there’s also talk of an oncoming economic depression. Seems we’ve endured the python section of the game only to now face the quicksand.</p>\n<p>But as yearning grows to get life back to normal some are also wondering just how great that ‘normal’ was. For many it seems that this stressful, confusing, financially uncertain period has been such a rare period of connection that it reminds us of a time we didn’t know that we’ve been missing ever since we were kids under that sprinkler.</p>\n <p>Lyrics</p>\n<p>There was no apology<br />\nWhere is the humanity<br />\nIt would have been better if it never happened ever</p>\n<p>You’ve got blood on your hands<br />\nThere&#8217;s no time to dance<br />\nTell me what are you going to do<br />\nYou’ve left stains and a mess<br />\nNo one&#8217;s impressed<br />\nTell me what’s your next move<br />\nYou’ve got blood on your hands<br />\nThere’s no time to dance<br />\nWhat are you going to do<br />\nThis states in a wreck<br />\nAnd we are expected to look up to you</p>\n<p>I don’t know about you but I’d never trust a man with blood on his hands</p>\n <p>Amongst all the assorted madness of the crisis, I think many of us have found the silver linings and often how the simple nature of our lockdown lives brings a reminder of the past and sometimes it’s a simple casserole dish that used to be Mum’s. </p>\n<p>This orange enamel number was responsible for every stew, casserole and pot roast that was consumed in our family home until it absconded with me to the North Melbourne sharehouse in the early ’90s. </p>\n<p>One of the culinary hits that I used to make for the boys in those days was an adaptation of a sweet-and-sour chicken recipe that Mum used to make. She favoured the Sunbeam electric fry pan over the casserole dish when she mixed chicken thighs with soy sauce, diced onion, a can of pineapple pieces and carrot sliced with a vegetable peeler.  </p>\n<p>My version ditched the chicken for a three-dollar tray of supermarket sausages and added a can of chopped tomatoes and curry powder instead of soy sauce. This ‘sausage stew’, plonked on the table in the old orange casserole dish, never failed to impress and achieved legendary status during the golden age of Frente. </p>\n<p>On Monday night, I drew heavily on those days of frugality when I pulled out the old orange banger and the recipe got a ‘plant based’ makeover, the sausages replaced with a tin of beans. The sorry looking arse-end of a pineapple got the call up and I also added a splash of vinegar before serving it up with some brown rice.   </p>\n<p>Michelle took one look and said, “This looks a bit ’70s” (which was the whole point) and then happily devoured the whole plate. It was comfort food reflecting two wonderful parts of my life. Alas, the kids thought it tasted shit.  </p>\n<p>It’s a strange world we now live in. </p>\n <p>This is not aloneness</p>\n<p>I could bear this pandemic better if<br />\nRight before it struck my sister wasn’t<br />\nEight months pregnant.<br />\nI’d bear it better if my heart<br />\nHadn’t just been broken.<br />\nI’d bear it better if I’d invested in<br />\nA fridge with more freezer space.<br />\nI have no fear of aloneness.<br />\nI’ve spent much of my life in emotional solitude:<br />\nA childhood alone with a depressed mother;<br />\nSchool holidays alone suffering from chronic illness;<br />\nTravelling abroad alone to develop skills<br />\nAs a writer who works alone.<br />\nNow, I don’t need to hold my family and friends, but<br />\nMy heart needs to hold the same space as them,<br />\nTo breathe the same air.<br />\nAnd when it comes to love<br />\nI’m not the platonic sort.<br />\nI need to touch and be touched, to rest my head on<br />\nTheir chest and hear them breathing.<br />\nProjects are falling to pieces but<br />\nI trust there will be others.<br />\nThere is no shortage of ideas,<br />\nBut it’s the feeling of being unmoored –<br />\nThe chance that the ideas<br />\nWill never see the light of day.<br />\nWhen people online talk about productivity,<br />\nI am being productive!<br />\nI am cooking and cleaning and sleeping<br />\nAnd that is part of the work too.<br />\nThe loss of routine means that days are<br />\nDefined by moments, like<br />\nFetching toilet paper from my brother’s house;<br />\nFaceTiming my newborn nephew, still pink;<br />\nCrying as I walk around the apartment<br />\nThinking of men inflicting hurt –<br />\nThe ones I’ve slept with, and the ones telling us<br />\nTo inject ourselves with bleach.<br />\nThank God for my cat and the new Fiona Apple album.</p>\n <p>During this surreal period everything has changed but looks superficially the same. I still walk everyday, from my house in inner western Sydney, to my warehouse studio . It&#8217;s sunny ,and the streets are full of people running or walking dogs. It feels like a perpetual Sunday ,only more crowded with everyone anxious to get out of the house .</p>\n<p>I keep reminding myself I cant meet friends , go to cafes, restaurants or anywhere beyond short walking distance.</p>\n<p>Besides my own paintings for future exhibitions, , I am also working on a number of collaborative projects , a ballet ,a cabaret and book of poetry .. all compromised by being unable to physically meet ,not knowing where and when we can.</p>\n<p>Right now I would be in our apartment /artist studio in Paris with my partner Bernard Ollis . My exhibition in Shanghai postponed to next year as have other international commitments.</p>\n<p>Things are bad for artists, events and commitments, cancelled or postponed , no idea when they can be rescheduled , this includes my major painting exhibition in Sydney: over a years work .. and a years income, very worrying , but I am in a better position than most people in the arts.</p>\n<p>I have been fascinated by the effect isolation , social distancing and the stream of frightening news has on the subconscious. This is a time of introspection, intense feeling and collective anxiety. Many people are experiencing vivid dreams containing thoughts that have been largely barred from consciousness.</p>\n<p>I am working on a number of things in the studio about this strange psychological state including a long artist book 5 metre &#8211; corona diary and a series of other works about dreams .</p>\n <p>Writing has been a consistent presence in my life for more than twenty years, along with reading, a lifelong habit, and running, which I have been doing on average five times a week for forty years (with occasional forced breaks due to injury). I have run in many cities in Australia and overseas. My favourite running locations include Wandsworth Common in London, along the Swan River in Perth, and several places in Melbourne, including the Birrarung (Yarra) River and Princes Park near my home.</p>\n<p>As a result of the corona virus ‘lockdown’ several of my favoured activities have stopped. But not the running and writing, which go hand-in-hand. Each of my quarantine days begins or ends with a run, bookended by writing and reading. If I did not run, the reading would continue, but the writing quickly dry up. In recent weeks my running track by the river had been as quiet as ever. As I run, I am most often alone, listening to birdsong, taking in the scents of river tannin and thinking about the writing work waiting at my desk for me to return home; a story, poem or essay I mull over as my body and mind thymically connect.</p>\n<p>My running at Princes Park has become a different, slightly chaotic affair. Even with the practice of social distancing, park runs have become a crowded affair. Many of those stuck indoors for much of the day, having taken the prime minister’s advice that it’s okay to exercise, seem to have chosen Princes Park as the place to be, even if they have never exercised before. While I’m presently happy to share the park with them, I do hope that when the lockdown ends that some of my park companions decide to curtail their newfound habit.</p>\n <p>I am going quite well so far in my self isolation.  In my late 70s I guess I am in that danger zone but consider myself fortunate to be in good health and with a reasonable degree of fitness.</p>\n<p>Last week I prepared my veggie beds for the winter crops. Then, out of the blue, came the Brush Turkeys who dug them up as soon as I turned my back.  They are very laid back birds.  Just sauntered off at a leisurely pace when I chased them with a “see if I care attitude”.  I found an online hint that they don’t like teddy bears.  I only had a large panda bear but hung that on the fence and it has worked even though my son said it looks like he has been crucified.  10 days now and they haven’t been back.  </p>\n<p>I also did some sewing and made three face masks from leftover Japanese material using copper bonsai wire in the nose section.  I now have masks which match my kitchen blind!  Just read that copper will kill  a virus particle in a matter of seconds.  </p>\n<p>Going for walks this week has been a pleasure.  The amazingly clear skies remind me of the New Zealand South Island where there is virtually no pollution.  With no rain forecast, I have been painting the weatherboards around the roof edge, only those I can reach from a small step ladder with an extension pole. </p>\n<p>I enjoy cooking and I am trying to be more adventurous.  Today I plan to make a seafood pie with salmon and prawns and an eggless chocolate cake from Jamie Oliver’s TV Show Keep Cooking and Carry on.</p>\n<p>So life goes on. Really missing my family, and things like catching up with friends for lunch or a coffee.</p>\n"
